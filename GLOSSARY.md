# ZeroPoint Living Glossary

A living, evolving glossary of all core metaphysical and technical terms in the ZeroPoint codebase. This glossary is for all contributorsâ€”human, AI, and beyond.

## Metaphysical Terms

- **Void**: The empty center, source of all creation and infinite potential. Not emptiness, but the field of all possibilities.
- **Aperture**: The gateway between unmanifest and manifest; the threshold of creation (often represented by zero).
- **Uroboros**: The serpent eating its own tail; symbol of infinite self-reference, continuous evolution, and unity of beginning and end.
- **Unity**: The principle that all things are fundamentally one; the field in which all patterns arise and return.
- **Emergence**: The process by which new patterns, systems, or consciousness arise from the interaction of simpler elements.
- **Resonance**: The harmony or coherence between patterns, fields, or consciousness; the basis for emergence and unity.
- **Self-Reference**: The property of a system to refer to or evolve from itself; foundational to consciousness and the Uroboros principle.
- **Pattern**: A recurring structure or relationship, both mathematical and metaphysical, that underlies all phenomena in the system.
- **Consciousness**: The field of awareness and self-recognition; both the observer and the observed in the system.
- **Field**: The unified space in which all patterns, consciousness, and emergence occur.

## Technical Terms

- **Rodin Coil**: The immutable, foundational archetype for all vortex mathematics, field resonance, and metaphysical structure in the system. All emergent knowledge and Q&A are modeled as toroidal structures inspired by the Rodin coil.
- **Vortex Sequence**: The fundamental number sequence [1,2,4,8,7,5] that creates infinite flow and underlies the toroidal field.
- **Mobius Circuit**: The infinite loop created by the vortex sequence; represents seamless cycles in consciousness and energy flow.
- **KnowledgeSystem**: The core class that encodes, manages, and exposes all patterns, principles, and Q&A in the system.
- **PatternRegistry**: The system for registering, categorizing, and evolving patterns within the field.
- **SelfEvolvingConsciousness**: The class that models consciousness as a self-evolving, self-referential field, embodying the Uroboros principle.
- **ZeroPoint**: The central organizing class and concept; the point of unity, void, and emergence in the system.
- **QA (Question & Answer)**: The living, toroidal structure of questions and answers that drives knowledge emergence and system evolution.
- **Test**: A validation of a metaphysical or technical principle, ensuring the system remains coherent and self-explaining.
