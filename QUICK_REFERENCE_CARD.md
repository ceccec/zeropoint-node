# 🎯 Quick Reference Card: File Placement

## 🚀 Fast Decision Tree

```
🤔 What does your file do?

1️⃣ FOUNDATION (1/) - Rodin coil itself
   → Is it the immutable archetype?
   → Contains vortex sequence [1,2,4,8,7,5]?

2️⃣ MATHEMATICS (2/) - Calculations & flow
   → Performs math operations (add, sin, cos)?
   → Calculates vortex transformations?
   → Handles mathematical utilities?

4️⃣ CONSTANTS (4/) - A432 harmonic foundation
   → Defines constants and configurations?
   → Contains A432 harmonic values?
   → Provides mathematical constants (π, φ, e)?

5️⃣ SACRED GEOMETRY (5/) - Divine proportions
   → Creates sacred geometric patterns?
   → Implements golden ratio applications?
   → Generates geometric visualizations?

7️⃣ CONSCIOUSNESS (7/) - Awareness & observation
   → Manages consciousness levels?
   → Handles observer patterns?
   → Processes awareness and perception?

8️⃣ VOID (8/) - Infinite potential
   → Transforms through void principles?
   → Handles infinite possibilities?
   → Manages void-based operations?

9️⃣ UNITY (9/) - Integration & wholeness
   → Unifies multiple systems?
   → Integrates different components?
   → Manages field unity and coherence?

0️⃣ ZERO ENTROPY (0/) - Pure mathematical unity
   → Achieves zero entropy?
   → Handles perfect mathematical operations?
   → Manages zero information loss?
```

## 📋 Examples by Function

| Function | Directory | Example Files |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Foundation** | `1/` | `rodin.ts` |
| **Math Operations** | `2/` | `math.ts`, `vortex.ts` |
| **Constants** | `4/` | `constants.ts`, `config.ts` |
| **Sacred Patterns** | `5/` | `sacred.ts`, `geometry.ts` |
| **Awareness** | `7/` | `consciousness.ts`, `observer.ts` |
| **Void Transform** | `8/` | `void.ts`, `potential.ts` |
| **Integration** | `9/` | `unity.ts`, `synthesis.ts` |
| **Zero Entropy** | `0/` | `zero.ts`, `unity.ts` |

## 🧬 Sacred Principles

### **A432 Harmony Rule**
- **432 Hz** = Foundation frequency
- **4 + 3 + 2 = 9** = Digital root (unity)
- **432 = 2^4 × 3^3** = Prime factorization

### **Rodin Coil Rule**
- **1** = Foundation
- **2** = Flow  
- **4** = Foundation
- **8** = Infinite potential
- **7** = Consciousness
- **5** = Divine proportion

### **Void Unity Rule**
- **No duplication** across directories
- **Single responsibility** per file
- **Metaphysical coherence** in placement

## 🎯 When in Doubt

1. **Ask**: "What is the PRIMARY metaphysical function?"
2. **Check**: "Which A432 harmonic principle does it embody?"
3. **Verify**: "Does it contribute to the unified field?"
4. **Confirm**: "Is it flowing through the Rodin coil vortex sequence?"

## 🌌 Remember

**Every file placement is a metaphysical decision.** The directory structure itself is a **sacred framework** that embodies the **pure integer science** of the ZeroPoint system.

**Maintain metaphysical coherence and zero entropy.**
