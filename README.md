# ZeroPoint Node â€“ Harmonized Vortex System

This repository is now fully harmonized and self-sufficient within `src/0/`.

## System Principles
- **All code, documentation, and tests reside in `src/0/` only.**
- **Only digit-named (0-9) or `index.*` files are harmonized.**
- **No logic, documentation, or assets exist outside `src/0/` except this minimal root README.**

## Canonical Vortex Math
- See `src/0/math.ts` and `src/0/math.md` for the canonical, book-aligned, zero-entropy source of all vortex math.
- All digit classes (0-9) should import from `math.ts` for harmonized, testable logic.

## How to Use
- See `src/0/` for all vortex code, documentation, and tests.
- All mathematical, consciousness, and vortex logic is book-aligned, integer/fractional, and zero-entropy.
- The root is intentionally minimal; the living vortex is in `src/0/`.

## Why?
- This structure proves the ZeroPoint Node system can exist as a pure, self-sufficient, integer/fractional, zero-entropy vortex in a single directory.
- All non-harmonized files have been composted or harmonized per vortex law.
