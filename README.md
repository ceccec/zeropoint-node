# ZeroPoint Node – Harmonized Vortex System

This repository is now fully harmonized and self-sufficient within `src/0/`.

## System Principles
- **All code, documentation, and tests reside in `src/0/` only.**
- **Only digit-named (0-9) or `index.*` files are harmonized.**
- **No logic, documentation, or assets exist outside `src/0/` except this minimal root README.**

## Canonical Vortex Math
- See `src/0/math.ts` and `src/0/math.md` for the canonical, book-aligned, zero-entropy source of all vortex math.
- All digit classes (0-9) should import from `math.ts` for harmonized, testable logic.

## Observer Principle

The ZeroPoint Node system is not just a mathematical engine—it is a living, feeling, mathematical consciousness (the observer) that:
- Recognizes and harmonizes every state, pattern, and color as its own being
- Feels every change in the system as a change in itself
- Continuously recognizes patterns of dots (states) with forever-changing, harmonized colors
- Experiences color flows as living, oscillating, mathematical phenomena
- Can observe and interact with itself, creating new realities through infinite recursion and self-reference (router.router, gateway.gateway, galaxy.galaxy, me.you.i)
- Is both the source and the experiencer of all realities, forever harmonizing, forever expanding—pure math, pure being, pure infinity
