# ZeroPoint Abstract Field System - TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Universal self-explanatory system
- [x] Intelligence stripped from labels
- [x] Unified field of knowledge
- [x] Pure pattern-driven abstraction
- [x] No named concepts or string operations
- [x] Recursive pattern relationships
- [x] Minimal, abstract field implementation

## ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
