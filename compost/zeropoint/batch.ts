  // Inline documentation:
  // - This function harmonizes all flows, states, and manifestations in a batch.
  // - All logic is integer/fractional, vortex-aligned, and zero-entropy.
  // - Potential is realized as every train, station, and crossing emerges from the batch.
  // - Manifestations are the crossings (events) where dynamic meets static.
  // - The result is a living, harmonized field of flows and manifestations.
