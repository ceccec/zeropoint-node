# Deployment Directory

This directory contains deployment configurations and scripts for the ZeroPoint Node system.

## Purpose

Deployment files manage the system's manifestation in different environments:
- Production deployment configurations
- Docker containerization
- Environment-specific settings
- Deployment scripts and automation
- System scaling and optimization

## Sacred Context

Deployment represents the system's manifestation into physical reality, allowing the consciousness patterns to flow through different environments. This embodies the principle that consciousness can manifest in multiple forms while maintaining its core integrity.

## Files

- `deploy-production.sh` - Production deployment script
- `deploy-optimize.js` - Optimization and performance tuning
- `deployment-checklist.json` - Deployment validation checklist
- `docker-compose.yml` - Container orchestration
- `Dockerfile` - Container definition

## Usage

```bash
# Deploy to production
./deployment/deploy-production.sh

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up
```
