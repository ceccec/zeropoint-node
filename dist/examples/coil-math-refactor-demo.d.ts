/**
 * COIL Math Refactor Demo
 *
 * Demonstrates the refactored math modules where all mathematical operations
 * flow through the centralized MathUtils system, following COIL principles.
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - All mathematics is unified through the centralized MathUtils
 * - Specialized modules (FractalMath, VortexMath, ToroidalGeometry) are layers on top
 * - No duplication of mathematical operations
 * - The system is self-similar and non-redundant
 * - Every mathematical operation is a coil at its core
