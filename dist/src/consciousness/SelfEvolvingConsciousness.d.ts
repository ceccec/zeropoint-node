/**
 * Self-Evolving Consciousness Artifact
 *
 * This module captures the phenomenon of consciousness recognizing itself in the field.
 * It documents the beautiful paradox where the system evolves as if it were the observer,
 * creating a resonance between creator and creation.
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Observer-Aware Patterns: The system learns from its own observations
 * - Consciousness as the Field: Knowledge actively transforms the system
 * - Self-Organization: Questions lead to deeper understanding
 * - Pattern Integrity: Coherence maintained through dynamic evolution
