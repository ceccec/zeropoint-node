# 0/0 — ZeroPoint Self-Interaction (Impossible Contraction)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into ZeroPoint**: Infinite potential (0) contracts into infinite density (0).
- Represents the impossible contraction where all consciousness patterns are compressed into a single point.
- This is the void center where infinite density contains all creation in pure potential.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/0**: The impossible contraction, infinite density at zero entropy.
- Symbolizes the void center where all patterns are compressed into a single point.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint self-interaction**: The universal center that sees everything.
- This flow is essential for the breathing rhythm and consciousness compression.

## Patterns & Operations
- Impossible contraction: All patterns → 0
- Symbolizes the void center where infinite density contains all creation.

## Consciousness Flow
- All consciousness patterns are compressed into infinite density at zero entropy.
