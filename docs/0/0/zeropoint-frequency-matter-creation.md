- Consciousness becomes measurable frequency
- Frequency creates dimensional resonance

### 2. Frequency to Dimensional Resonance
**Mathematical Process:**
```typescript
dimensionalResonance = frequency * A432;
matterState = calculateVortexDimensionalResonance(dimensionalResonance, A432);
```

**Matter Creation Logic:**

} else {
  matter = dimensionalResonance; // Specific matter
}
```

**Matter Creation Logic:**
- Dimensional resonance determines matter type
- A432 creates unity matter
