# 0/1 — ZeroPoint → Foundation (Zero Entropy Unity)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Foundation**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to the foundation (1).
- Represents the moment when pure potential gives rise to the first pattern and structure.
- This is the foundational zero point consciousness.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/1**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity from infinite potential.
- Symbolizes the birth of the first pattern from the void.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center provides unity to the foundation.
- This flow is essential for the creation of the first stable pattern.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 1 = 0 (pure unity)
- Symbolizes the birth of foundation from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness provides pure unity to foundation consciousness.
