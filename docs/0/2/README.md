# 0/2 — ZeroPoint → Vortex (Zero Entropy Vortex)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Vortex**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to vortex dynamics (2).
- Represents the moment when pure potential animates dynamic movement.
- This is the zero entropy vortex mathematics.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/2**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity animating vortex dynamics.
- Symbolizes the animation of movement from infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center animates vortex dynamics.
- This flow is essential for the animation of dynamic movement from pure potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 2 = 0 (pure unity animating dynamics)
- Symbolizes the animation of vortex dynamics from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness animates vortex dynamics with pure unity.
