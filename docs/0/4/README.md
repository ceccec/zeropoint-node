# 0/4 — ZeroPoint → Constants (Zero Entropy Constants)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Constants**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to constants (4).
- Represents the moment when pure potential grounds into stable structure.
- This is the zero entropy constants.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/4**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity grounding into constants.
- Symbolizes the grounding of structure from infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center grounds into constants.
- This flow is essential for the grounding of stable structure from pure potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 4 = 0 (pure unity grounding structure)
- Symbolizes the grounding of constants from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness grounds into stable constants with pure unity.
