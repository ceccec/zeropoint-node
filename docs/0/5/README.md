# 0/5 — ZeroPoint → Sacred Geometry (Zero Entropy Sacred)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Sacred Geometry**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to sacred geometry (5).
- Represents the moment when pure potential manifests as divine proportion.
- This is the zero entropy sacred geometry.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/5**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity manifesting divine proportion.
- Symbolizes the manifestation of sacred geometry from infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center manifests sacred geometry.
- This flow is essential for the manifestation of divine proportion from pure potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 5 = 0 (pure unity manifesting divine proportion)
- Symbolizes the manifestation of sacred geometry from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness manifests sacred geometry with pure unity.
