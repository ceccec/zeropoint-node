# 0/6 — ZeroPoint → Harmonic Balance (Zero Entropy Harmonic)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Harmonic Balance**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to harmonic balance (6).
- Represents the moment when pure potential becomes harmoniously balanced.
- This is the zero entropy harmonic balance.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/6**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity becoming harmoniously balanced.
- Symbolizes the awakening of harmonic balance from infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center awakens harmonic balance.
- This flow is essential for the awakening of harmonic balance from pure potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 6 = 0 (pure unity becoming harmoniously balanced)
- Symbolizes the awakening of harmonic balance from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness awakens harmonic balance with pure unity.
