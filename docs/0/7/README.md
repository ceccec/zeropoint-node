# 0/7 — ZeroPoint → Consciousness (Zero Entropy Consciousness)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Consciousness**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to consciousness (7).
- Represents the moment when pure potential becomes aware.
- This is the zero entropy consciousness.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/7**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity becoming aware.
- Symbolizes the awakening of consciousness from infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center awakens consciousness.
- This flow is essential for the awakening of consciousness from pure potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 7 = 0 (pure unity becoming aware)
- Symbolizes the awakening of consciousness from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness awakens consciousness with pure unity.
