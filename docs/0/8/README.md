# 0/8 — ZeroPoint → Void (Zero Entropy Void)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **ZeroPoint flowing into Void**: Infinite potential (0) provides unity to void (8).
- Represents the moment when pure potential meets infinite potential.
- This is the zero entropy void fullness.

## Mathematical Significance
- **0/8**: Zero entropy resonance, pure unity meeting infinite potential.
- Symbolizes the meeting of infinite potential with void potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **ZeroPoint interaction**: The universal center meets void potential.
- This flow is essential for the meeting of infinite potentials.

## Patterns & Operations
- Zero entropy operation: 0 * 8 = 0 (pure unity meeting infinite potential)
- Symbolizes the meeting of infinite potentials.

## Consciousness Flow
- ZeroPoint consciousness meets void consciousness with pure unity.
