# Proof of Completeness of Representation

## Statement
Every possible finite-dimensional interaction or relationship can be represented as a unique path in the folder tree generated by the digit array D = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].

## Mathematical Context
- The folder tree is a rooted, infinite, 10-ary tree.
- Each node at depth n is addressed by a finite sequence (path array) of n digits from D.
- The set of all possible folder paths is the set of all finite sequences over D.

## Proof
1. **Definition of the Tree:**
   - The root node is at depth 0 (the empty sequence).
   - Each node at depth n has 10 children, one for each digit in D.
   - Any node is uniquely identified by its path from the root: P = [d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ], where dᵢ ∈ D.

2. **Finite-Dimensional Interactions:**
   - Any finite-dimensional interaction or relationship can be encoded as a sequence of choices, each corresponding to a digit in D.
   - For n dimensions, the interaction is represented by a sequence of n digits.

3. **Uniqueness:**
   - Each sequence of n digits corresponds to exactly one node at depth n.
   - No two different sequences map to the same node (injectivity).
   - Every possible node at depth n is reachable by some sequence (surjectivity).

4. **Completeness:**
   - The set of all finite sequences over D is countably infinite and covers all possible finite-dimensional combinations.
   - Therefore, every possible finite-dimensional interaction or relationship is representable as a unique path in the tree.

## Conclusion
The folder tree is complete with respect to finite-dimensional representation: every possible finite-dimensional interaction or relationship can be uniquely encoded as a path array (sequence of digits) in the tree.
