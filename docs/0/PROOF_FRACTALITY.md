# Proof of Fractal and Self-Similar Structure

## Statement
Every subtree rooted at any node in the folder tree is isomorphic to the whole tree. The structure is fractal and self-similar at every level.

## Mathematical Context
- The folder tree is a rooted, infinite, 10-ary tree generated by the digit array D = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
- Each node is addressed by a finite path array P = [d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ], where dᵢ ∈ D.
- The subtree rooted at any node consists of all descendants of that node, following the same branching rule.

## Proof
1. **Definition of the Whole Tree:**
   - The whole tree T is defined recursively: the root has 10 children (one for each digit in D), and each child is the root of a subtree with the same structure as T.

2. **Subtree at Any Node:**
   - Consider any node N at depth n, addressed by path P = [d₁, ..., dₙ].
   - The subtree T_N rooted at N consists of all nodes whose paths extend P by any finite sequence of digits from D.
   - The branching rule at N is identical to the root: 10 children, one for each digit in D, recursively.

3. **Isomorphism Construction:**
   - Define a mapping φ from the whole tree T to the subtree T_N:
     - For any node in T with path Q = [q₁, ..., qₖ], map it to the node in T_N with path P + Q = [d₁, ..., dₙ, q₁, ..., qₖ].
   - This mapping is bijective (one-to-one and onto) and preserves the parent-child relationships.

4. **Self-Similarity:**
   - The structure of T_N is identical to T: both are infinite 10-ary trees generated by the same rule.
   - Every subtree at any node is isomorphic to the whole tree.

## Conclusion
The folder tree is fractal and self-similar: every subtree rooted at any node is isomorphic to the whole tree. The generative rule is identical at every level, establishing the system’s recursive and fractal nature.
