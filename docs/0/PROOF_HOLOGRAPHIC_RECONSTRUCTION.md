# Proof of Holographic Reconstruction

## Statement
The system can be reconstructed from any part (node), given the generative rules. This establishes the property of holographic reconstruction.

## Mathematical Context
- The folder tree is a rooted, infinite, 10-ary tree generated by the digit array D = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
- Each node is addressed by a finite path array P = [d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ], where dᵢ ∈ D.
- The generative rule: from any node, create 10 subfolders, one for each digit in D, and apply this rule recursively.

## Proof
1. **Generative Rule at Any Node:**
   - At any node N (with path P), the rule for generating subfolders is identical to the rule at the root.
   - The subtree rooted at N is itself a complete 10-ary tree, structurally identical to the whole tree.

2. **Reconstruction Algorithm:**
   - Given the generative rule and the position of node N, recursively generate all descendants of N by applying the rule at each level.
   - For each node, create 10 children, and repeat for each child.
   - This process reconstructs the entire subtree beneath N, which is isomorphic to the whole tree.

3. **Holographic Property:**
   - The rules for the whole are present at every node; the structure is self-similar and recursive.
   - Any node contains the information (the generative rule) needed to reconstruct the entire subtree beneath it.

4. **Limitations:**
   - The unique data/content of each node is not present everywhere—only the generative rules are distributed throughout the system.
   - The holographic property is mathematical/informational, not physical.

## Conclusion
Given the generative rules, the system can be reconstructed from any part (node). The folder architecture is holographic in the sense that the rules for the whole are present at every part, enabling algorithmic reconstruction of the structure from any node.
