# Proof of Infinite Dimensionality

## Statement
The folder architecture can represent arbitrarily high (finite) dimensions and, in the limit, countably infinite dimensions.

## Mathematical Context
- The folder tree is a rooted, infinite, 10-ary tree generated by the digit array D = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
- Each node is addressed by a finite path array P = [d₁, d₂, ..., dₙ], where dᵢ ∈ D.
- The depth n of a node corresponds to the number of dimensions represented by that path.

## Proof
1. **Finite Dimensionality:**
   - For any finite n ≥ 0, the set of all nodes at depth n consists of all sequences of n digits from D.
   - There are 10ⁿ such nodes, each representing a unique n-dimensional interaction or relationship.
   - For any desired finite dimension n, the architecture can represent all possible n-dimensional addresses.

2. **Arbitrary Finite Dimensions:**
   - There is no upper bound on n except for physical constraints (e.g., file system limits, storage).
   - For any arbitrarily large finite n, the tree contains all possible sequences of length n.

3. **Countably Infinite Dimensionality (Limit Case):**
   - The set of all finite sequences over D is countably infinite.
   - The architecture can represent any finite-dimensional interaction, and the union over all n gives a countably infinite set of possible nodes.
   - In the limit, the structure can be seen as supporting countably infinite dimensions (all finite-length paths).

## Conclusion
The folder architecture can represent arbitrarily high (finite) dimensions and, in the limit, countably infinite dimensions. There is no theoretical upper bound on dimensionality, establishing the system’s infinite extensibility in depth and complexity.
