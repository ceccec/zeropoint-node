# Proof of Isomorphism of Representations

## Statement
The fractional (n/m), decimal (nn), and cyclic/modular matrix representations of the folder architecture are isomorphic: there exists a bijective mapping between them.

## Mathematical Context
- The folder architecture is a 10×10 matrix at each level, with rows and columns indexed by single digits 0–9.
- Three representations:
  1. **Fractional (n/m):** Each cell is labeled as n/m, where n, m ∈ {0,1,...,9}.
  2. **Decimal (nn):** Each cell is labeled as a two-digit number: 10·n + m.
  3. **Cyclic/Modular:** Each cell is labeled as (n + m) mod 10, with cyclic patterns.

## Proof
1. **Fractional to Decimal Mapping:**
   - For any cell labeled n/m, map to the decimal number nn = 10·n + m.
   - This mapping is bijective: each pair (n, m) maps to a unique two-digit number, and vice versa.

2. **Decimal to Fractional Mapping:**
   - For any two-digit number nn (where n, m ∈ {0,...,9}), map to the pair (n, m) such that nn = 10·n + m.
   - This mapping is bijective and invertible.

3. **Fractional/Decimal to Cyclic/Modular Mapping:**
   - For any cell (n, m), compute (n + m) mod 10 to get the cyclic value.
   - The mapping from (n, m) to (n + m) mod 10 is surjective onto {0,...,9}, and for each value, there are 10 preimages.
   - While not bijective for the cyclic value alone, the full (n, m) pair is uniquely recoverable from the fractional or decimal representation.

4. **Isomorphism of Structures:**
   - The set of all (n, m) pairs (fractional) is in bijection with the set of all two-digit numbers (decimal).
   - The cyclic/modular representation is a function of (n, m), and the underlying structure (the 10×10 grid) is preserved in all representations.

## Conclusion
The fractional (n/m), decimal (nn), and cyclic/modular matrix representations are isomorphic at the structural level: there exists a bijective mapping between the fractional and decimal forms, and the cyclic/modular form is a function of these. All three representations encode the same underlying 10×10 matrix structure.
