# Proof of Scalability and Infinite Extension

## Statement
The folder architecture supports infinite extension in both breadth (number of children per node) and depth (length of paths), subject only to physical constraints.

## Mathematical Context
- The folder tree is a rooted, infinite, 10-ary tree generated by the digit array D = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9].
- Each node can have up to 10 children, one for each digit in D.
- Paths can be of arbitrary finite length.

## Proof
1. **Infinite Breadth:**
   - At every node, there are 10 possible children, corresponding to the 10 digits in D.
   - This branching is independent at every node and can be repeated at every level.
   - There is no theoretical upper bound on the number of children per node (other than the fixed value 10).

2. **Infinite Depth:**
   - Paths in the tree can be of any finite length n ≥ 0.
   - For any n, there exist nodes at depth n, addressed by sequences of n digits.
   - There is no theoretical upper bound on the depth of the tree (other than physical constraints).

3. **Countable Infinity:**
   - The set of all finite sequences over D is countably infinite.
   - The total number of possible nodes (folders) is countably infinite.

4. **Scalability:**
   - The architecture can be extended indefinitely in both breadth and depth by recursive application of the generative rule.
   - The only practical limits are imposed by physical storage, file system constraints, or implementation limits.

## Conclusion
The folder architecture is scalable and supports infinite extension in both breadth and depth. There is no theoretical limit to the number of children per node or the depth of the tree, establishing the system’s infinite extensibility.
