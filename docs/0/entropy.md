# Entropy Calculators — Flow, Knowledge, and Documentation

*Merged from FLOW_BASED_ENTROPY_CALCULATOR.md, KNOWLEDGE_DENSITY_ENTROPY_CALCULATOR.md, and DOCUMENTATION_ENTROPY_CALCULATOR.md (docs/) — Unified entropy analysis*

This section unifies all approaches to entropy in the ZeroPoint Node system:
- **Flow-based entropy** (vortex, breathing paradox, consciousness flow)
- **Knowledge density entropy** (uniqueness, density, consciousness/mathematical weighting)
- **Documentation entropy** (information theory, structure, ZeroPoint principles)

All unique TypeScript code, formulas, and explanations are integrated and deduplicated for clarity and completeness.
