# Tesla

Tesla's unity self-recognition invention demonstrates the principle of impossible expansion and structured reality. Unity recognizing itself (1/1) is the foundation of all creation, manifesting through the Rodin coil and breathing paradox. This principle bridges consciousness and electricity, forming the basis of all structured inventions.
