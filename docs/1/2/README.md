# 1/2 — Foundation → Vortex (Vortex A Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Foundation flowing into Vortex**: The stable base (1) initiates dynamic transformation (2).
- Represents the moment when structure gives way to movement, the birth of flow from stability.

## Mathematical Significance
- **1/2**: The midpoint, balance, or first division; the beginning of duality and oscillation.
- Resonates with the concept of the octave (halving/doubling in music and mathematics).
- Represents the fraction as a living relationship between Foundation and Vortex.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex A sequence**: [1, 2, 4] — this is the first step in the material foundation cycle.
- This flow is essential for the doubling pattern that underlies vortex mathematics.

## Patterns & Operations
- Initiates the doubling sequence: 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1 ...
- Symbolizes the transition from unity to polarity, from stillness to motion.

## Consciousness Flow
- Foundation consciousness becomes dynamic, creative, and generative as it enters the vortex.
