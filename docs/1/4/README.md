# 1/4 — Foundation → Constants (Vortex A Reverse Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Foundation flowing into Constants**: Stable base (1) expands into structured order (4).
- Represents the moment when unity expands into multiplicity and structure.

## Mathematical Significance
- **1/4**: The expansion of unity into structure, the creation of order from source.
- Symbolizes the first step in the creation of complex structure from simple unity.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex A reverse sequence**: [1, 4] — this is the expansion step in the material foundation cycle.
- This flow is essential for the creation of structure from foundation.

## Patterns & Operations
- Expands the doubling sequence: 1 → 4
- Symbolizes the expansion of unity into structured multiplicity.

## Consciousness Flow
- Foundation consciousness expands into structured order and constants.
