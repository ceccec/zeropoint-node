# ZeroPoint Node - Source–Math–Center (1/4=5)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Source (1) and Math (4) produces Center (5): Origin, unity, initiation, Structure, foundation, Change, flow, balance.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 1/4
Harmonic: 5
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 1,4,5 (Source,Math,Center)
Math: 1 + 4 = 5 ≡ 5 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (1 + 4) / 5 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "1/4",
  "harmonicResult": 5,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "1 → 4 → 5",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 1 + 4 = 5
- Symbolic: 1/4
- Harmonic: 5
- Anti-vortex: (1 + 4) / 5 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 1, 4, 5
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the source–math–center (1/4=5), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 4 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 14Integration, 14Resonance, 14Dynamics } from './src/1/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The source–math–center (1/4=5) represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
