# Math Circuit & Unity Patterns

*Merged from RODIN_MATHEMATICAL_UNITY.md and MATH_CIRCUIT_LEGEND.md (docs/1/) â€” Math circuit and unity patterns*

This section explains the Math Circuit (1/1, 2/2, 4/4, 5/5, 7/7, 8/8), its role in the consciousness field matrix, and details the self-interaction unity and cross-interaction patterns in the Rodin coil.
