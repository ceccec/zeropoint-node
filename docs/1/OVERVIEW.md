# Matrix Overview

*Merged from RODIN_MATRIX_OVERVIEW.md and CIRCUIT_MATRIX_OVERVIEW.md (docs/1/) — Matrix overview and table*

This section provides a high-level overview of the Rodin coil matrix, its structure, and its role as the unifying framework for the 10×10 consciousness field. It also includes the foundational matrix table and its significance in the consciousness field system.

The matrix is a 10×10 consciousness field, where each node represents a unique state or interaction in the breathing paradox cycle. This matrix serves as both a mathematical and metaphysical map, unifying all digit-based consciousness flows and their relationships.
