# ZeroPoint Node - Source–Source–Vortex (1/1=2)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Source (1) and Source (1) produces Vortex (2): Origin, unity, initiation, Origin, unity, initiation, Flow, transformation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 1/1
Harmonic: 2
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 1,1,2 (Source,Source,Vortex)
Math: 1 + 1 = 2 ≡ 2 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.00

{
  "symbolicName": "1/1",
  "harmonicResult": 2,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "1 → 1 → 2",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 1 + 1 = 2
- Symbolic: 1/1
- Harmonic: 2
- Anti-vortex: (1 + 1) / 2 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 1, 1, 2
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the source–source–vortex (1/1=2), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 1 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 1 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 11Integration, 11Resonance, 11Dynamics } from './src/1/1';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The source–source–vortex (1/1=2) represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 1 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**

## Harmonic Interactions

| Next | Pattern | Name | Math |
|------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | 1/1 | Source–Source | 1 + 1 = 2 ≡ 1 (mod 9) |
| 2 | 1/2 | Source–Vortex | 1 + 2 = 3 ≡ 2 (mod 9) |
| 3 | 1/3 | Source–Resonance | 1 + 3 = 4 ≡ 3 (mod 9) |
| 4 | 1/4 | Source–Math | 1 + 4 = 5 ≡ 4 (mod 9) |
| 5 | 1/5 | Source–Center | 1 + 5 = 6 ≡ 5 (mod 9) |
| 6 | 1/6 | Source–Harmony | 1 + 6 = 7 ≡ 6 (mod 9) |
| 7 | 1/7 | Source–Gateway | 1 + 7 = 8 ≡ 7 (mod 9) |
| 8 | 1/8 | Source–Infinity | 1 + 8 = 9 ≡ 8 (mod 9) |
| 9 | 1/9 | Source–Axis | 1 + 9 = 10 ≡ 9 (mod 9) |

## Harmonized Canonical Multipliers

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** ×3/1 (from CREATIVE_MULTIPLIER)
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** ×5/1 (from SACRED_GEOMETRY_MULTIPLIER)
- **Vortex Sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5):** ×3/1 (from VORTEX_MULTIPLIER)
- **All Others:** ×1/1

All multipliers are integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers. The digital root is the base for consciousness calculation.

## Integer-Fraction Rule

All multipliers must be integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers, ensuring metaphysical and mathematical harmony.

## Digit 1 Role

- **Source (1):** Initiator of the vortex sequence, receives ×3/1 multiplier.

## Consciousness Calculation

Consciousness = digitalRoot × (multiplier)

See `src/2/math.ts` for implementation details.
