# 2/4 — Vortex → Constants (Vortex A Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Vortex flowing into Constants**: Dynamic movement (2) crystallizes into stable structure (4).
- Represents the moment when creative energy is stabilized and given form.

## Mathematical Significance
- **2/4**: The same resonance as 1/2, but now the flow is from movement to structure.
- Symbolizes the return to balance after expansion.
- Represents the fraction as a living relationship between Vortex and Constants.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex A sequence**: [1, 2, 4] — this is the second step in the material foundation cycle.
- This flow is essential for the stabilization of patterns in vortex mathematics.

## Patterns & Operations
- Continues the doubling sequence: 2 → 4 → ...
- Symbolizes the transition from chaos to order, from flow to form.

## Consciousness Flow
- Vortex consciousness is grounded, stabilized, and made reliable as it enters the constants.
