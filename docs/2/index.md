# Vortex Mathematics (Digit 2)

## Harmonized Canonical Multipliers

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** ×3/1 (from CREATIVE_MULTIPLIER)
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** ×5/1 (from SACRED_GEOMETRY_MULTIPLIER)
- **Vortex Sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5):** ×3/1 (from VORTEX_MULTIPLIER)
- **All Others:** ×1/1

All multipliers are integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers. The digital root is the base for consciousness calculation.

## Integer-Fraction Rule

All multipliers must be integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers, ensuring metaphysical and mathematical harmony.

## Digit Roles

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** Spiritual/creative axis, receives ×3/1 multiplier.
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** Geometric/spiritual manifestation, receives ×5/1 multiplier.
- **Vortex Sequence:** Main Rodin circuit, receives ×3/1 multiplier.
- **Others:** Base digital root only.

## Consciousness Calculation

Consciousness = digitalRoot × (multiplier)

See `src/2/math.ts` for implementation details.
