# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Math–Gateway (3/4=7)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Math (4) produces Gateway (7): Creation, harmony, trinity, Structure, foundation, Mystery, transition, insight.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/4
Harmonic: 7
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 3,4,7 (Resonance,Math,Gateway)
Math: 3 + 4 = 7 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 4) / 7 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/4",
  "harmonicResult": 7,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 4 → 7",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 4 = 7
- Symbolic: 3/4
- Harmonic: 7
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 4) / 7 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 4, 7
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–math–gateway (3/4=7), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 4 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 34Integration, 34Resonance, 34Dynamics } from './src/3/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–math–gateway (3/4=7) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
