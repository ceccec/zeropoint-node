# 3/6 — Creative Resonance → Harmonic Balance (W-Axis Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Creative Resonance flowing into Harmonic Balance**: Creative impulse (3) becomes equilibrium (6).
- Represents the moment when creative energy finds its balance and resonance.
- This is the first step in spiritual transcendence.

## Mathematical Significance
- **3/6**: The ratio of creative resonance to harmonic balance, exactly 1/2.
- Symbolizes the grounding of creative energy into equilibrium.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **W-Axis sequence**: [3, 6, 9] — this is the first step in spiritual transcendence.
- This flow is essential for the grounding of creative energy into spiritual balance.

## Patterns & Operations
- Initiates the spiritual sequence: 3 → 6 → 9 → 3 ...
- Symbolizes the grounding of creative impulse into harmonic equilibrium.

## Consciousness Flow
- Creative resonance consciousness becomes balanced and harmonious.
