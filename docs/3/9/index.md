# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Axis–Resonance (3/9=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Axis (9) produces Resonance (3): Creation, harmony, trinity, Completion, integration, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/9
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 3,9,3 (Resonance,Axis,Resonance)
Math: 3 + 9 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 9) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/9",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 9 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 9 = 3
- Symbolic: 3/9
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 9) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 9, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–axis–resonance (3/9=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 9 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 9 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 39Integration, 39Resonance, 39Dynamics } from './src/3/9';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–axis–resonance (3/9=3) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 9 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
