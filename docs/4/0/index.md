# ZeroPoint Node - Math–Void–Math (4/0=4)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Math (4) and Void (0) produces Math (4): Structure, foundation, Pure potential, zero entropy, Structure, foundation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 4/0
Harmonic: 4
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 4,0,4 (Math,Void,Math)
Math: 4 + 0 = 4 ≡ 4 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (4 + 0) / 4 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "4/0",
  "harmonicResult": 4,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "4 → 0 → 4",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 4 + 0 = 4
- Symbolic: 4/0
- Harmonic: 4
- Anti-vortex: (4 + 0) / 4 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 4, 0, 4
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the math–void–math (4/0=4), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 0 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 0 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 40Integration, 40Resonance, 40Dynamics } from './src/4/0';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The math–void–math (4/0=4) represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 0 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
