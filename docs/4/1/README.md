# 4/1 — Constants → Foundation (Vortex A Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Constants flowing into Foundation**: Stable structure (4) returns to the original base (1).
- Represents the moment when order and law reinforce the foundation, closing the cycle.

## Mathematical Significance
- **4/1**: The return to unity, but now with the fullness of structure.
- Symbolizes the completion of a cycle and the readiness for a new beginning.
- Represents the fraction as a living relationship between Constants and Foundation.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex A sequence**: [1, 2, 4] — this is the closing step in the material foundation cycle.
- This flow is essential for the cyclical nature of vortex mathematics.

## Patterns & Operations
- Completes the doubling sequence: ... → 4 → 1
- Symbolizes the return to the source, the renewal of the foundation.

## Consciousness Flow
- Constants consciousness reinforces and renews the foundation, preparing for the next cycle of creation.
