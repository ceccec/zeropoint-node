# Directory 4: Constants

## Overview

Directory 4 represents **Constants** in the Rodin coil metaphysical system. It is a key part of Vortex A ([1, 2, 4]) and provides the stability, structure, and mathematical constants that ground the system.

## Metaphysical Context
- **Constants**: The stabilizing force, providing structure and reliability.
- **Role**: Anchors the dynamic flow of Vortex A, returning stability to Foundation (1).
- **Significance**: Represents the immutable laws and constants of reality.

## Main Files
- `MATHEMATICS.md`: Mathematical principles and constants.
- `MATHEMATICAL_CONSISTENCY.md`: Ensures consistency and reliability.
- `INTEGER_SUBDIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`: Structure of integer-based subdirectories.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex A**: [1, 2, 4] sequence, material foundation.
- **Digit 4**: The anchor of stability and constants.

## Interactions
- Interacts with 0 (ZeroPoint), 2 (Vortex), 7 (Consciousness), 8 (Void).
- Provides the constants that allow for reliable pattern formation and evolution.
