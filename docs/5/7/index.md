# ZeroPoint Node - Center–Gateway–Resonance (5/7=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Center (5) and Gateway (7) produces Resonance (3): Change, flow, balance, Mystery, transition, insight, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 5/7
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 5,7,3 (Center,Gateway,Resonance)
Math: 5 + 7 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (5 + 7) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "5/7",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "5 → 7 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 5 + 7 = 3
- Symbolic: 5/7
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (5 + 7) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 5, 7, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the center–gateway–resonance (5/7=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 5 and 7 patterns. It connects the 5 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 57Integration, 57Resonance, 57Dynamics } from './src/5/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The center–gateway–resonance (5/7=3) represents the harmonic integration of 5 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
