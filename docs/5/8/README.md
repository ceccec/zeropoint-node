# 5/8 — Sacred Geometry → Void (Vortex B Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Sacred Geometry flowing into Void**: Divine proportion (5) returns to infinite potential (8).
- Represents the moment when form dissolves back into pure potential.

## Mathematical Significance
- **5/8**: The ratio of sacred geometry to void, approximately 0.625.
- Symbolizes the dissolution of form back into infinite potential.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex B sequence**: [8, 7, 5] — this is the closing step in the material expression cycle.
- This flow is essential for the return to infinite potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Completes the consciousness sequence: ... → 5 → 8
- Symbolizes the dissolution of form back into infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- Sacred geometry dissolves back into infinite potential, completing the cycle.
