# ZeroPoint Node - Center–Center–Source (5/5=1)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Center (5) and Center (5) produces Source (1): Change, flow, balance, Change, flow, balance, Origin, unity, initiation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 5/5
Harmonic: 1
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 10.00
Pattern: 5,5,1 (Center,Center,Source)
Math: 5 + 5 = 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (5 + 5) / 1 = 10.00

  "antiVortexDecimal": 10.00,
  "vortexPath": "5 → 5 → 1",
  "antiVortexPath": "10.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 5 + 5 = 1
- Symbolic: 5/5
- Harmonic: 1
- Anti-vortex: (5 + 5) / 1 = 10.00
- Vortex Sequence: 5, 5, 1
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 10.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the center–center–source (5/5=1), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 5 and 5 patterns. It connects the 5 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 55Integration, 55Resonance, 55Dynamics } from './src/5/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The center–center–source (5/5=1) represents the harmonic integration of 5 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (10.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**

## Harmonic Interactions

| Next | Pattern | Name | Math |
|------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | 5/1 | Center–Source | 5 + 1 = 6 ≡ 1 (mod 9) |
| 2 | 5/2 | Center–Vortex | 5 + 2 = 7 ≡ 2 (mod 9) |
| 3 | 5/3 | Center–Resonance | 5 + 3 = 8 ≡ 3 (mod 9) |
| 4 | 5/4 | Center–Math | 5 + 4 = 9 ≡ 4 (mod 9) |
| 5 | 5/5 | Center–Center | 5 + 5 = 10 ≡ 5 (mod 9) |
| 6 | 5/6 | Center–Harmony | 5 + 6 = 11 ≡ 6 (mod 9) |
| 7 | 5/7 | Center–Gateway | 5 + 7 = 12 ≡ 7 (mod 9) |
| 8 | 5/8 | Center–Infinity | 5 + 8 = 13 ≡ 8 (mod 9) |
| 9 | 5/9 | Center–Axis | 5 + 9 = 14 ≡ 9 (mod 9) |

## Harmonized Canonical Multipliers

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** ×3/1 (from CREATIVE_MULTIPLIER)
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** ×5/1 (from SACRED_GEOMETRY_MULTIPLIER)
- **Vortex Sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5):** ×3/1 (from VORTEX_MULTIPLIER)
- **All Others:** ×1/1

All multipliers are integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers. The digital root is the base for consciousness calculation.

**Source:** `src/3/3/paradox.ts`, `src/5/5/paradox.ts`

## Integer-Fraction Rule

All multipliers must be integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers, ensuring metaphysical and mathematical harmony.

## Digit 5 Role

- **Sacred Geometry (5):** Geometric/spiritual manifestation, receives ×5/1 multiplier (special case).

## Consciousness Calculation

Consciousness = digitalRoot × (multiplier)

See `src/2/math.ts` for implementation details.
