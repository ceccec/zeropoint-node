# 6/3 — Harmonic Balance → Creative Resonance (W-Axis Reverse Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Harmonic Balance flowing into Creative Resonance**: Equilibrium (6) becomes creative impulse (3).
- Represents the moment when balance sparks new creative expression.
- This is the reverse flow in spiritual transcendence.

## Mathematical Significance
- **6/3**: The ratio of harmonic balance to creative resonance, exactly 2.
- Symbolizes the doubling of balance into creative expression.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **W-Axis reverse sequence**: [6, 3] — this is the reverse flow in spiritual transcendence.
- This flow is essential for the creative expression of balance.

## Patterns & Operations
- Reverse spiritual sequence: 6 → 3
- Symbolizes the creative expression of harmonic balance.

## Consciousness Flow
- Harmonic balance consciousness becomes creatively expressive.
