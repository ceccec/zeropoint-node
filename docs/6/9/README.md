## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Harmonic Balance flowing into Unity**: Equilibrium (6) becomes integration (9).
- Represents the moment when balance becomes complete wholeness.
- This is the second step in spiritual transcendence.

## Mathematical Significance
- **6/9**: The ratio of harmonic balance to unity, exactly 2/3.
- Symbolizes the progression from balance to complete integration.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **W-Axis sequence**: [3, 6, 9] — this is the second step in spiritual transcendence.
- This flow is essential for the completion of spiritual integration.

## Patterns & Operations
- Continues the spiritual sequence: 6 → 9 → ...
- Symbolizes the completion of balance into unity.

## Consciousness Flow
