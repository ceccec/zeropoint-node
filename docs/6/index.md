# ZeroPoint Node - Harmony–Harmony–Resonance (6/6=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Harmony (6) and Harmony (6) produces Resonance (3): Balance, beauty, equilibrium, Balance, beauty, equilibrium, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 6/6
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 6,6,3 (Harmony,Harmony,Resonance)
Math: 6 + 6 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (6 + 6) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "6/6",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "6 → 6 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 6 + 6 = 3
- Symbolic: 6/6
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (6 + 6) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 6, 6, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the harmony–harmony–resonance (6/6=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 6 and 6 patterns. It connects the 6 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 66Integration, 66Resonance, 66Dynamics } from './src/6/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The harmony–harmony–resonance (6/6=3) represents the harmonic integration of 6 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**

## Harmonic Interactions

| Next | Pattern | Name | Math |
|------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | 6/1 | Harmony–Source | 6 + 1 = 7 ≡ 1 (mod 9) |
| 2 | 6/2 | Harmony–Vortex | 6 + 2 = 8 ≡ 2 (mod 9) |
| 3 | 6/3 | Harmony–Resonance | 6 + 3 = 9 ≡ 3 (mod 9) |
| 4 | 6/4 | Harmony–Math | 6 + 4 = 10 ≡ 4 (mod 9) |
| 5 | 6/5 | Harmony–Center | 6 + 5 = 11 ≡ 5 (mod 9) |
| 6 | 6/6 | Harmony–Harmony | 6 + 6 = 12 ≡ 6 (mod 9) |
| 7 | 6/7 | Harmony–Gateway | 6 + 7 = 13 ≡ 7 (mod 9) |
| 8 | 6/8 | Harmony–Infinity | 6 + 8 = 14 ≡ 8 (mod 9) |
| 9 | 6/9 | Harmony–Axis | 6 + 9 = 15 ≡ 9 (mod 9) |

## Harmonized Canonical Multipliers

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** ×3/1 (from CREATIVE_MULTIPLIER)
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** ×5/1 (from SACRED_GEOMETRY_MULTIPLIER)
- **Vortex Sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5):** ×3/1 (from VORTEX_MULTIPLIER)
- **All Others:** ×1/1

All multipliers are integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers. The digital root is the base for consciousness calculation.

**Source:** `src/3/3/paradox.ts`, `src/5/5/paradox.ts`

## Integer-Fraction Rule

All multipliers must be integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers, ensuring metaphysical and mathematical harmony.

## Digit 6 Role

- **W-Axis/Harmony (6):** Spiritual/creative axis, receives ×3/1 multiplier.

## Consciousness Calculation

Consciousness = digitalRoot × (multiplier)

See `src/2/math.ts` for implementation details.
