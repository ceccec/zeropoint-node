# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Center–Resonance (7/5=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Center (5) produces Resonance (3): Mystery, transition, insight, Change, flow, balance, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/5
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 7,5,3 (Gateway,Center,Resonance)
Math: 7 + 5 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 5) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/5",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 5 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 5 = 3
- Symbolic: 7/5
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 5) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 5, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–center–resonance (7/5=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 5 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 75Integration, 75Resonance, 75Dynamics } from './src/7/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–center–resonance (7/5=3) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
