# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Infinity–Harmony (7/8=6)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Infinity (8) produces Harmony (6): Mystery, transition, insight, Power, manifestation, Balance, beauty, equilibrium.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/8
Harmonic: 6
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.50
Pattern: 7,8,6 (Gateway,Infinity,Harmony)
Math: 7 + 8 = 15 ≡ 6 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 8) / 6 = 2.50


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/8",
  "harmonicResult": 6,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 2.50,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 8 → 6",
  "antiVortexPath": "2.50 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 8 = 6
- Symbolic: 7/8
- Harmonic: 6
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 8) / 6 = 2.50
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 8, 6
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.50 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–infinity–harmony (7/8=6), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 8 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 8 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 78Integration, 78Resonance, 78Dynamics } from './src/7/8';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–infinity–harmony (7/8=6) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 8 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.50) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
