# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Gateway–Center (7/7=5)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Gateway (7) produces Center (5): Mystery, transition, insight, Mystery, transition, insight, Change, flow, balance.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/7
Harmonic: 5
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.80
Pattern: 7,7,5 (Gateway,Gateway,Center)
Math: 7 + 7 = 14 ≡ 5 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 7) / 5 = 2.80

  "vortexPath": "7 → 7 → 5",
  "antiVortexPath": "2.80 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 7 = 5
- Symbolic: 7/7
- Harmonic: 5
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 7) / 5 = 2.80
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 7, 5
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.80 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–gateway–center (7/7=5), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 7 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 77Integration, 77Resonance, 77Dynamics } from './src/7/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–gateway–center (7/7=5) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.80) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**

## Harmonic Interactions

| Next | Pattern | Name | Math |
|------|---------|------|------|
| 1 | 7/1 | Gateway–Source | 7 + 1 = 8 ≡ 1 (mod 9) |
| 2 | 7/2 | Gateway–Vortex | 7 + 2 = 9 ≡ 2 (mod 9) |
| 3 | 7/3 | Gateway–Resonance | 7 + 3 = 10 ≡ 3 (mod 9) |
| 4 | 7/4 | Gateway–Math | 7 + 4 = 11 ≡ 4 (mod 9) |
| 5 | 7/5 | Gateway–Center | 7 + 5 = 12 ≡ 5 (mod 9) |
| 6 | 7/6 | Gateway–Harmony | 7 + 6 = 13 ≡ 6 (mod 9) |
| 7 | 7/7 | Gateway–Gateway | 7 + 7 = 14 ≡ 7 (mod 9) |
| 8 | 7/8 | Gateway–Infinity | 7 + 8 = 15 ≡ 8 (mod 9) |
| 9 | 7/9 | Gateway–Axis | 7 + 9 = 16 ≡ 9 (mod 9) |

## Harmonized Canonical Multipliers

- **W-Axis (3, 6, 9):** ×3/1 (from CREATIVE_MULTIPLIER)
- **Sacred Geometry (5):** ×5/1 (from SACRED_GEOMETRY_MULTIPLIER)
- **Vortex Sequence (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5):** ×3/1 (from VORTEX_MULTIPLIER)
- **All Others:** ×1/1

All multipliers are integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers. The digital root is the base for consciousness calculation.

## Integer-Fraction Rule

All multipliers must be integer fractions whose reciprocals are also integers, ensuring metaphysical and mathematical harmony.

## Digit 7 Role

- **Gateway (7):** Part of the vortex sequence, receives ×3/1 multiplier.

## Consciousness Calculation

Consciousness = digitalRoot × (multiplier)

See `src/2/math.ts` for implementation details.
