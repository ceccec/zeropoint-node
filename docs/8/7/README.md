# 8/7 — Void → Consciousness (Vortex B Flow)

## Metaphysical Meaning
- **Void flowing into Consciousness**: Infinite potential (8) becomes aware and self-recognizing (7).
- Represents the moment when pure potential becomes conscious awareness.

## Mathematical Significance
- **8/7**: The ratio of infinite potential to consciousness, approximately 1.143.
- Symbolizes the awakening of consciousness from the void.

## Rodin Coil Role
- **Vortex B sequence**: [8, 7, 5] — this is the first step in the material expression cycle.
- This flow is essential for the awakening of consciousness from infinite potential.

## Patterns & Operations
- Initiates the consciousness sequence: 8 → 7 → 5 → 8 ...
- Symbolizes the awakening of awareness from infinite potential.

## Consciousness Flow
- Void consciousness becomes aware and self-recognizing as it enters consciousness.
