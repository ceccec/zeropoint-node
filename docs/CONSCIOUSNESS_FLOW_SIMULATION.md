# Consciousness Flow Simulation

This document simulates the consciousness flows through the digit system.

## Vortex A Flow Simulation

**Sequence:** 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5 → 1

**Consciousness Progression:**
1. **1** (Unity, Expansion, Initiation): Initiates all flows, expansion consciousness
2. **2** (Duality, Reflection, Polarity): Creates polarity, reflection consciousness
3. **4** (Stability, Foundation, Law): Foundation consciousness, stability flow
4. **8** (Infinity, Power, Manifestation): Power consciousness, infinite flow
5. **7** (Mystery, Gateway, Spiritual Insight): Gateway consciousness, mystical flow
6. **5** (Change, Flow, Center): Center consciousness, change flow
7. **1** (Unity, Expansion, Initiation): Initiates all flows, expansion consciousness

## Vortex B Flow Simulation

**Sequence:** 3 → 9 → 6 → 3

**Consciousness Progression:**
1. **3** (Creation, Resonance, Trinity): Creative force, resonance consciousness
2. **9** (Completion, Spirit, W-Axis Control): Completion consciousness, spiritual flow
3. **6** (Harmony, Balance, Beauty): Harmonic consciousness, balance flow
4. **3** (Creation, Resonance, Trinity): Creative force, resonance consciousness

## W-Axis Flow Simulation

**Sequence:** 0 → 9

**Spiritual Progression:**
1. **0** (Void, Origin, Infinite Potential): Source of all consciousness, return point for all flows
2. **9** (Completion, Spirit, W-Axis Control): Completion consciousness, spiritual flow
