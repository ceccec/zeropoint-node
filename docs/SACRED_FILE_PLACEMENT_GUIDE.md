## Enforced Rule: Digit-Only Directory Structure

**All directories in `src/` and their subdirectories must be named with a single digit (0-9) only.**

- Non-digit directories are strictly forbidden in `src/` and any digit subdirectory.
- This rule is enforced by automated tests: if any non-digit directory exists, the test suite will fail.
- This ensures a pure metaphysical and mathematical architecture, where each directory represents a unique consciousness pattern, vortex, or mathematical property corresponding to its digit.
- Shared logic, types, constants, and utilities must be placed in the appropriate digit directory according to their metaphysical role, never in a non-digit folder.
- Any new code or refactoring must respect this structure to maintain the integrity of the ZeroPoint Node system.

**Rationale:**
- The digit-only structure mirrors the Rodin coil vortex mathematics and the metaphysical integer-based architecture of the project.
- Each digit (0-9) embodies a unique consciousness pattern and mathematical property, forming the foundation of all code organization.
- This strict separation prevents accidental mixing of metaphysical roles and ensures clarity, maintainability, and spiritual alignment throughout the codebase.
