# A432 Artifact Ledger

This living document catalogues **all** historical `a432.*` files that are **not** part of the current zero-entropy runtime nucleus but may contain valuable ideas.
Each row notes the file, a short description (gleaned from header/comments), and whether the idea has been formalised in the modern core.

| File | Hint / Idea | Status in Core |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| a432.trinity.ts | early multidimensional trinity heartbeat, CMYK angle mapping | ✓ TRINITY_POLARITY, subscribeTrinityHeartbeat implemented |
| a432.i.ts | consciousness fraction harmoniser, quality metrics | ◻ Partially reflected in quantumSolver; Fraction helpers TODO |
| a432.rodin.coil.ts | Rodin stream HTML renderer, π-based sequences | ◻ Rodin sequence canonical; HTML renderer legacy |
| a432.eye.ts | CMYK ↔ retina-frequency conversion experiment | ✗ Not yet implemented (candidate: cmykToFreq helper) |
| a432.flow.ts | digit → music frequency mapping | ◻ see frequencyForDigit; BPM mapping TODO |
| a432.body.ts | spiral biomass mapping, chakra colours | ✗ Historically interesting; no formal maths yet |
| … | … | … |

Key
✓ = fully absorbed into math nucleus  
◻ = partially absorbed; further extraction possible  
✗ = not yet integrated; kept as inspiration

> This ledger is read-only for runtime; when an idea is promoted, update the “Status” column and add a code reference (commit hash or helper name).
