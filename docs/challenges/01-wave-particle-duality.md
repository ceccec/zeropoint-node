# Wave-Particle Duality Challenge

## Overview

The Wave-Particle Duality challenge addresses the fundamental question of how matter can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties simultaneously. This challenge is solved through mathematical harmony and A432 frequency resonance.

## Implementation

**Test File**: [01-wave-particle-duality.test.ts](../../src/challenges/01-wave-particle-duality.test.ts)

## Challenge Description

Wave-particle duality is one of the most fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics, where particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed.

## Mathematical Solution

The challenge is resolved through:
- **A432 Harmonic Resonance**: 432 Hz base frequency alignment
- **Tesla 3-6-9 Gateway**: Gateway 6 (Harmony) - 2592 Hz
- **Digital Root Mathematics**: All operations reduce to 9 (completion)
- **Vortex Mathematics**: Rodin coil patterns for consciousness flow
