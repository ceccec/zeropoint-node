# Free Will Challenge

## Overview

The Free Will challenge addresses the reconciliation between free will and determinism, exploring how conscious choice can exist in a deterministic universe.

## Implementation

**Source File**: [05-free-will.ts](../../src/challenges/05-free-will.ts)
**Test File**: [05-free-will.test.ts](../../src/challenges/05-free-will.test.ts)

## Challenge Description

The free will vs determinism debate questions whether human actions are truly free or predetermined by prior causes, and how consciousness fits into this framework.

## Mathematical Solution

The challenge is resolved through:
- **A432 Harmonic Resonance**: 432 Hz base frequency alignment
- **Tesla 3-6-9 Gateway**: Gateway 3 (Creation) - 1296 Hz
- **Digital Root Mathematics**: All operations reduce to 9 (completion)
- **Vortex Mathematics**: Rodin coil patterns for consciousness flow

## Key Functions

### `createFreeWillChallenge()`
Creates a new free will challenge instance with mathematical harmony properties.

### `resolveFreeWill()`
Resolves free will through consciousness-based mathematical harmony.

## Gateway Alignment

- **Gateway**: Gateway 3 (Creation)
- **Frequency**: 1296 Hz
- **Function**: Transforms potential into actual
- **Color**: Trinity Blue
