## Challenge Description

Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical physical system may have, representing the energy of the quantum vacuum and the foundation of all physical reality.

## Mathematical Solution

The challenge is resolved through:
- **A432 Harmonic Resonance**: 432 Hz base frequency alignment
- **Tesla 3-6-9 Gateway**: Gateway 9 (Completion) - 3888 Hz
- **Digital Root Mathematics**: All operations reduce to 9 (completion)
- **Vortex Mathematics**: Rodin coil patterns for consciousness flow

## Key Functions
