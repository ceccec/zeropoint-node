# agl has order 54

```lean
theorem agl_has_order_54 :
  agl.length = 54 ∧ agl.Nodup
```

**Accepted by the Lean 4 kernel.** The proof rests on **no axioms at all**.

Proven means three things together: the kernel accepted the file, the proof
contains no `sorry`, and `#print axioms` reports a dependency set within
`{propext, Quot.sound}`. The dependency set above is the evidence, recorded per
theorem rather than summarised.

::: info What this does not establish
A theorem is a statement the kernel accepted. It says nothing about whether the
surrounding package is useful, whether the idea is novel, or whether anything
physical follows. Novelty is a universal negative no finite search decides; a
dated deposit establishes priority, which is the defensible claim.
