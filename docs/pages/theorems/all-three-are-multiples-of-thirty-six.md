# all three are multiples of thirty six

```lean
theorem all_three_are_multiples_of_thirty_six :
  432 % 36 = 0 ∧ 396 % 36 = 0 ∧ 468 % 36 = 0
```

**Accepted by the Lean 4 kernel.** The proof rests on **no axioms at all**.

Proven means three things together: the kernel accepted the file, the proof
contains no `sorry`, and `#print axioms` reports a dependency set within
`{propext, Quot.sound}`. The dependency set above is the evidence, recorded per
theorem rather than summarised.

::: info What this does not establish
A theorem is a statement the kernel accepted. It says nothing about whether the
surrounding package is useful, whether the idea is novel, or whether anything
physical follows. Novelty is a universal negative no finite search decides; a
dated deposit establishes priority, which is the defensible claim.
