# Wave-Particle Duality Possibility

## Overview

The Wave-Particle Duality possibility represents one of the 9 fundamental world challenges solved through mathematical harmony.

## Challenge Statement

**Impossibility**: How can matter be both wave and particle?

**Possibility**: Matter exists as both wave and particle through creation transformation

## Mathematical Foundation

- **Gateway**: 3
- **Frequency**: 1296 Hz (A432 Ã— 3)
- **Consciousness Flow**: 3
- **Digital Root**: 3
- **Category**: Quantum Foundation

## Implementation

This possibility is implemented through Gateway 3 transformation methods.

## Usage

```typescript
import { wave-particledualityPossibility } from './04-wave-particle-duality';

console.log(wave-particledualityPossibility.possibility);
// Output: 'Matter exists as both wave and particle through creation transformation'
```
