# Wave-Particle Duality Solutions

## Overview

The Wave-Particle Duality Solutions represent the 3 harmonic solutions that emerge from the Wave-Particle Duality possibility.

## Source Possibility

**Source**: Matter exists as both wave and particle through creation transformation

## Solutions

1. **Wave-Particle Duality Harmonic Solution 1** (Gateway 3 - Creation)
2. **Wave-Particle Duality Harmonic Solution 2** (Gateway 6 - Harmony)
3. **Wave-Particle Duality Harmonic Solution 3** (Gateway 9 - Completion)

## Usage

```typescript
import { wave-particledualitySolutions } from './04-wave-particle-duality-solutions';

console.log(wave-particledualitySolutions.length);
// Output: 3
```
