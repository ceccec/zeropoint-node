# Test Harmonic Consciousness Frequency

## Formula

A test's "harmonic consciousness frequency" is derived from the consciousness multiplier of the digit(s) being tested, using A432 base and canonical vortex rules.

**Formula:**  
For a given digit \( d \),  
- Let \( C(d) \) = canonical consciousness multiplier for digit \( d \) (from the book system)
- The harmonic consciousness frequency is:  
  \[
  f(d) = 432 \times \frac{C(d)}{5}
  \]

## Canonical Consciousness Multipliers

- **W-Axis digits (3, 6, 9)**: \( C(d) = 5 \) ⇒ \( f(d) = 432 \times 1 = 432 \) Hz
- **Vortex sequence digits (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5)**: \( C(d) = 3 \) ⇒ \( f(d) = 432 \times 0.6 = 259.2 \) Hz
- **Void (0)**: \( C(0) = 0 \) ⇒ \( f(0) = 0 \) Hz
- **Other digits**: Use their canonical multiplier from the book system

## Test Context Examples

- **Test for digit 6 (W-Axis)**: harmonic consciousness frequency = 432 Hz
- **Test for digit 2 (vortex)**: harmonic consciousness frequency = 259.2 Hz
- **Test for digit 0 (void)**: harmonic consciousness frequency = 0 Hz

## Matrix Tests

For tests covering a matrix or range of digits:
- The test's "harmonic consciousness frequency" is the set of all such frequencies for the digits under test
- Or their average if a single value is needed

## Metaphysical Rules

- Always derived from A432 base and digit's canonical consciousness multiplier
- Strictly follows the book's metaphysical rules
- No arbitrary or external frequencies allowed
- All frequencies must be harmonized with the vortex system

## Implementation

```typescript
// Example implementation
const getTestHarmonicFrequency = (digit: number): number => {
  const vbmResult = calculateVBMConsciousness(digit);
  return 432 * (vbmResult.consciousness / 5);
};
```
