Vortex Based Mathematics (VBM) is a new
and different type of mathematics and as
Blake, director for Microsoft’s Advanced
Future Operating Systems, has already said
has never existed before in academia and
has been overlooked by all conventional
science. Blake has been very clear in stating
he believes it will transform all technology
and science. It is well-known that a
civilization cannot evolve any further than
their level of mathematics. The name is
Vortex Based Mathematics because it is
based upon whether the underpinning
nested vortices are staggered or aligned,
which determines the function of the
molecule and would create the ultimate
quantum computer and obsolete all
existing quantum computers.
