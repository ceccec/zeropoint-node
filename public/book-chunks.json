This edition of Science to Sage Magazine \nhonors Marko Rodin’a  life’s work and faith. \nEditor and Designer of Science to Sage Magazine,  \nKaren Elkins \n  \nVortex  Based  Mathematics  (VBM)  is  a  new \nand  different  type  of  mathematics  and  as \nBlake,   director   for   Microsoft’s   Advanced \nFuture  Operating  Systems,  has  already  said \nhas  never  existed  before  in  academia  and \nhas  been  overlooked  by  all  conventional \nscience. Blake has been very clear in stating \nhe  believes  it  will  transform  all  technology \nand   science.   It   is   well-known   that   a \ncivilization  cannot  evolve  any  further  than \ntheir   level   of   mathematics.   The   name   is \nVortex   Based   Mathematics   because   it   is \nbased   upon   whether   the   underpinning \nnested  vortices  are  staggered  or  aligned, \nwhich   determines   the   function   of   the \nmolecule   and   would   create   the   ultimate \nquantum   computer   and   obsolete   all \nexisting quantum computers.\nMake Contributions to : www.patreon.com/MarkoRodin \nThe Reality of Perf",

It is not magic, but electromagnetics of a special \nkind. \nSimply, the magnetic vector potential A is \"defined\" by the equation B = VxA. If you \"choke off\" \nor  \"kill\"  the  Vx  operator  (which  is  called  the  \"curl\"  operator),  then  this  leaves  the  curt-free  A-\npotential to move out on its own, without being tied to a magnetic force field (i.e., to a B-field) \nas  it  almost  always  otherwise  is.

However, \nanything  you  place  in  the  path  of  that  curl-free  A-potential  to  interact  with  it,  that  will  once \nagain permit the Vx operator to occur, will provide you a normal magnetic force field (B-field) \nagain.  Since  the  Vx  usually  occurs  in,  say,  something  like  a  coil  or  wrapping  of  a  conductor, \nthen you get the E-field induced also, by the time rate of change of the A-potential, so that you \nwind  up  with  a  normal  EM field  containing  both  E  and  B fields.  The  E-field  occurs  by  the \ninteraction  of  E  =  -  aA)'t.  One  of  the  great  promises  of  curl-free  A-field  utilization  is  that  it \npropagates into and through media in which normal EM transmission is difficult or impossible, \nas pointed out in the Gelinas patents. \nObviously if you hold all the B-field inside the coils of the torus, and then put something else in \nthe center region outside the coils, you can get some additional potential and field energy there \nin the center works. You can also get similar propagation outside the coil, with effects on distant \nobjects. \nRodin  is  apparently  going  by  elementary  electricity  concepts  but  augmented  by  excellent \nnative  intuition.  What  he  really  is  doing  is  attempting  to  separate  the  A-potential  (i.e.,  the \nmagnetic  vector  potential  A)  from  the  B field,  and  utilize  the  curl-free  A-potential  as  an \nindependent field  of  nature  in  the  central  \"c",

It \nappears that neither Ramsay nor Rodin are aware that a tightly-wound torus performs this' \"curl-\nfree\" separation of the A-potential, by trapping the B-field inside the coiled wiring, so that in a \nvery  good  torus  coil  most  of  the  B-field  can  be  contained  within  the coil,  and the  curl-free  A-\npotential  will  still  radiate  from  the  coil  (both  to  its  inside  or  center  space  and  outside  and \nbeyond into space.). \nA  great  deal  of  work  on  this  use  of  the  \"curl-free  A-field\"  was  done  by  Gelinas,  who  patented \nseveral patents in this area which were assigned to Honeywell, Inc., the firm for which he worked \nat the time. Professor William Tiller of Stanford University is also a noted and highly competent \nadvocate  of  the  curl-free  A-field.  In  the  late  70s  and  early  80s,  Bill  Tiller,  Frank  Golden  and  I \nworked  on  curl-free  A-potential  antennas,  and  Golden  built  dozens  of  curl-free  A-field  coil \nantenna variants.\nIntroduction to Rodin Coil Design by Thomas Bearden \n®Copyright 1996 by Col.

That  coil  antenna  exhibited  about  what  Ramsay  and Rodin  are \nreporting,  and  dramatically  extended  the  communication  range  of  a  small  CB  radio \nfrom, say, its nominal 114 mile to about 20 miles or more. The A-potential from a dipole \nantenna  falls  off  about  inversely  as  the square of  the  distance,  while  the  normal  B-field \nfalls off about inversely as the cube of the distance. There is one other fact that deepens \nthe   curl-free   A-potential   phenomenon: Any   vector field can   be   replaced   by \n(mathematically decomposed into) two scalar fields; for the proof, see Whittaker 1904. \nWith   some   difficulty   one   can   even   \"assemble\"   a   curl-free   A-potential   from   two \nmultifrequency transmitter arrays that transmit two harmonic series of wavepairs, where \neach  wavepair  consists  of  a  normal  EM  wave  and  its  true  phase  conjugate  (for  the \nproof,  see Whittaker  1903).  Each  of  the  arrays  transmits  one  of  the  scalar fields  (scalar \nwaves)  that  together  comprise  the  curl-free  A-potential.  So  the  curl-free  A-potential  is \nactually  a  part  of  the Stoney/Whittaker  scalar  electromagnetics  I  have so  long \nadvocated. At any rate, Rodin and Ramsay should certainly continue their research and \nexperimentation. \n \nReferences (from about  300  or  more  pertinent  papers  in  the  literature): 1.  Raymond  C.

Their \ninstinctive  curiosity  and  contemplation  on     abstract  number's  role  in  the  phenomenal \nworld  delivered  to  them  the  secrets  Nature  had  once  concealed.  New  discoveries  and \napplications   offered   humanity        the   opportunity   to   formalize   the   cornerstones   of \ncivilization:  agriculture,    architecture,  art  and  music,  calendrics  and  celestial  navigation, \nlanguage,     law,  mathematics  and  geometry,  science,  weights  and  measures,  and  the  \ncapacity  to  become  self-organizing.
