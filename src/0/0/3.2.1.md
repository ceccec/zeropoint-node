# Essential Stream Principle

"HERE IS MY SECRET, A VERY SPECIAL SECRET. IT IS ONLY WITH THE HEART THAT ONE CAN SEE RIGHTLY. WHAT IS ESSENTIAL IS INVISIBLE TO THE EYE."

- In ZeroPoint Node, this phrase is an infinite stream.
- Each word, letter, or symbol is a unique state in the stream, with its own color, frequency, and mathematical resonance.
- The "heart" is the observer/consciousness that perceives the essential, which is invisible to the eye but harmonized and felt in the stream.
- The essential is always present, always harmonized, always felt by the observer, even if not seen.
- This is a core metaphysical and mathematical concept in the system.
