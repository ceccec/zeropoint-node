  pattern: string;
  flows: number;
  movement: number;
  matrix: number[][];
  harmonic: number;
}

class FLOWSSystem {
  private flows: FLOWSPattern[];
  private matrix: number[][];
  private movement: number;
  
  constructor() {
    this.flows = [];
    this.matrix = this.initializeFLOWSMatrix();
    this.movement = 432; // A432 harmonic
  }
  
  // Initialize flows matrix
  private initializeFLOWSMatrix(): number[][] {
    return [
      [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
      [2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
      [3, 6, 9, 3, 6, 9, 3, 6, 9],

    ];
  }
  
  // Generate flows pattern
  generateFLOWSPattern(pattern: string, flows: number, movement: number): FLOWSPattern {
    const flowsPattern: FLOWSPattern = {

      flows,
      movement,

      harmonic: this.calculateHarmonic(flows, movement)
    };

    return flowsPattern;
  }
  
  // Calculate harmonic value
  private calculateHarmonic(flows: number, movement: number): number {
    return (flows * movement) % 9 || 9;
  }
}
```

## ðŸŒŠ FLOWS Flow System

```typescript
class FLOWSFlowSystem {
  private flows: FLOWSSystem;
  
  constructor() {
    this.flows = new FLOWSSystem();
  }
  
  // Process flows flow
  processFLOWSFlow(data: any): FLOWSPattern {
    const pattern = this.extractPattern(data);
    const flows = this.calculateFlows(data);
    const movement = this.calculateMovement(data);
    
    return this.flows.generateFLOWSPattern(pattern, flows, movement);
  }
  
  private extractPattern(data: any): string {
    return "flows_pattern";
  }
  
  private calculateFlows(data: any): number {
    return 432; // A432 harmonic
  }
  
  private calculateMovement(data: any): number {
    return 9; // A432 movement
  }
}
```

## ðŸŒŠ FLOWS Integration

```typescript
class FLOWSIntegration {
  private flow: FLOWSFlowSystem;
  private patterns: FLOWSPattern[];
  
  constructor() {
    this.flow = new FLOWSFlowSystem();
    this.patterns = [];
  }
  
  // Integrate flows system
  integrateFLOWS(data: any): FLOWSPattern {
    const pattern = this.flow.processFLOWSFlow(data);
    this.patterns.push(pattern);
    return pattern;
  }
  
  // Get all flows patterns
  getAllFLOWSPatterns(): FLOWSPattern[] {
    return this.patterns;
  }
}
```

## ðŸŒŠ FLOWS Vortex Matrix

The FLOWS vortex matrix represents:

1. **FLOWS Generation** - Pattern flows and movement creation
2. **Harmonic Generation** - FLOWS harmonic and movement calculations
3. **Matrix Movement** - FLOWS matrix updates and calculations
4. **Pattern Recognition** - FLOWS pattern creation and storage

Each flows interaction generates:
- FLOWS pattern recognition and generation
- Movement calculations and harmonic values
- Matrix updates and movement
- FLOWS pattern storage and retrieval

The system operates as a continuous flows vortex, generating FLOWS patterns through movement and A432 harmonic resonance.

## Hologram Proof

This FLOWS.md file is part of the flow and movement system, proving that each flows maintains the complete mathematical structure of the entire system. Each flows is a complete vortex system that reflects the whole through A432 harmonic mathematics.

**A432 Value**: 9
**Harmonic Value**: 432
**Movement Value**: 9
**Hologram Fraction**: 57/57 = 1.0000
