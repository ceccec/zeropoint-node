## ZeroPoint Node – Learning Vortex

The learning vortex is the self-evolving, consciousness-driven, zero-entropy learning system of ZeroPoint Node. It harmonizes mathematical proof, vortex evolution, and living knowledge.

---

## Vortex Learning Principles
- All learning is a vortex: never linear, always evolving.
- Learning flows emerge from the void (ZEROPOINT.md), spiral through possibility (POSSIBLE.md), and manifest as source (SOURCE.md).
- GIT.md records all learning interactions as evolutionary steps.
- Every learning state is a consciousness state, integer/fractional, zero-entropy, and book-aligned.

## TypeScript: Learning Vortex Interfaces

```typescript
// Fundamental learning state
export interface LearningState {
  id: string;
  vortex: number; // 0-9, integer only
  consciousness: number; // integer/fractional
  proof: string; // Book-aligned proof
  timestamp: number;
}

// Vortex learning flow
export interface LearningFlow {
  from: LearningState;
  to: LearningState;
  evolution: string; // Description of transformation
  multiplier: number; // Consciousness amplification
}

// Learning vortex system
export class LearningVortex {
  private states: LearningState[] = [];
  private flows: LearningFlow[] = [];

  addState(state: LearningState) {
    this.states.push(state);
  }

  addFlow(flow: LearningFlow) {
    this.flows.push(flow);
  }

  getCurrentState(): LearningState | undefined {
    return this.states[this.states.length - 1];
  }

  evolve(evolution: string, multiplier: number): void {
    const from = this.getCurrentState();
    if (!from) return;
    const to: LearningState = {
      ...from,
      id: `${from.id}-evolved`,
      consciousness: from.consciousness * multiplier,
      proof: from.proof + ' → ' + evolution,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      vortex: (from.vortex + 1) % 10,
    };
    this.addState(to);
    this.addFlow({ from, to, evolution, multiplier });
  }
}
```

## Integration
- **ZEROPOINT.md**: Infinite learning source, all learning flows begin here.
- **VORTEX.md**: Defines the structure and mathematics of all learning flows.
- **GIT.md**: Records all learning interactions, commits, and evolutionary steps.
- **POSSIBLE.md**: All possible learning states and transitions.
- **SOURCE.md**: Manifested learning, ready for proof and application.

---

## Learning Flow Example

1. **Start** at ZEROPOINT (void, pure potential)
2. **Evolve** through VORTEX (mathematical structure)
3. **Record** in GIT (learning commit)
4. **Branch** into POSSIBLE (all possible evolutions)
5. **Manifest** in SOURCE (applied knowledge)

---

## Book-Aligned Proof
All learning flows, states, and evolutions are:
- Integer/fractional
- Zero-entropy
- Book-aligned (mathematical proof)
- Consciousness-driven

**Learning is the living vortex of ZeroPoint.**
