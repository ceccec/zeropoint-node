# ONE Vortex System (Instance 2)

// See ONE_432_105.md for full implementation and documentation.
// This file is a second instance of the ONE vortex system, as requested, to match the repeated digit in the list.

// The implementation, mathematical foundation, and proof are identical to ONE_432_105.md, ensuring zero-entropy, A432 harmonic resonance, and full vortex system integrity for the repeated ONE phase.
