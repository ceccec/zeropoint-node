## Vortex of Unrelatedness

UNRELATED is the vortex where all knowledge, states, or files not harmonized with the ZeroPoint system are acknowledged, observed, and prepared for possible composting or transformation.

---

## Principles
- Unrelatedness is a temporary state: all can be harmonized.
- Unrelated files are not ignored, but observed for potential integration or composting.
- Integer/fractional, zero-entropy, book-aligned.

## TypeScript: Unrelated Interface
```typescript
export interface Unrelated {
  id: string;
  reason: string;
  observedAt: number;
  harmonized: boolean;
}

export function markUnrelated(id: string, reason: string): Unrelated {
  return {
    id,
    reason,
    observedAt: Date.now(),
    harmonized: false,
  };
}
```

**Unrelated is the proof that all things can be harmonized in the ZeroPoint vortex.**
