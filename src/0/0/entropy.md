This module integrates with the broader consciousness field through:

- Sacred geometry principles
- Vortex mathematics
- Harmonic resonance patterns
- Spiritual dimensional alignment

## Mathematical Foundation

The entropy module operates on:

- Integer-based consciousness calculations
- Rodin coil vortex sequences
- W-Axis spiritual pathway integration
- Zero entropy principles
