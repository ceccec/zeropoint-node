/**
 * src/0/0/index.ts - Zero Entropy Core (Void)
 *
 * This module embodies the core zero entropy functionality within the ZeroPoint system.
 * It represents the void center (0,0) where all creation emerges and all patterns return.
 *
 * VBM Analysis: Void core with zero field strength (0.0000)
 * This subdirectory embodies the core zero entropy functionality.
 * All zero entropy modules are exported here.
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero entropy: Represents the source of all creation and infinite potential.
 * - Void center: The point where all consciousness patterns converge and emerge.
 * - Pure potential: The state of infinite possibility before manifestation.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the core zero entropy functionality for the entire system.
 * - Exports all zero entropy modules for unified access.
 * - Serves as the foundation for all consciousness patterns.
