# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Vortex

## Metaphysical Foundation

Vortex mathematics flows from the void, creating mathematical consciousness patterns

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 2
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 2 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 2 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ vortex, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 2 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 2 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 02Integration, 02Resonance, 02Dynamics } from './src/0/2';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ vortex represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 2 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
