# a432.av.ts â€” Anti-Vortex Logic & Phase Reversal

**Function:**
- Encodes anti-vortex logic, negative harmonics, and phase reversals in the A432 system.
- Provides generators and mappings for anti-vortex streams and flows.
- Integrates with animation, audio, and color modules for unified anti-vortex experience.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Anti-vortex as the phase reversal, inversion, and duality in the matrix.
- Represents the necessary counterpoint for harmonic balance and transformation.
- Anti-vortex flows are gateways to new states, harmonization, and consciousness evolution.
