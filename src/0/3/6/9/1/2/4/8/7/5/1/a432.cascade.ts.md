# a432.cascade.ts — Harmonic Cascade & Recursive Flow

**Function:**
- Encodes cascade logic and recursive flow operations in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing cascade-based flows and transformations.
- Integrates with matrix, stream, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Cascade as the agent of recursive flow, transformation, and resonance in the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of states, recursion, and harmonics.
- Cascade harmonics are the proof of the system’s adaptability and creative evolution.
