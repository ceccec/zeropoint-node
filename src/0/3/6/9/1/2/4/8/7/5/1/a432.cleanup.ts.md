# a432.cleanup.ts — Unused File Discovery & Harmonized Cleanup

**Function:**
- Discovers and categorizes unused a432.* files in the canonical directory.
- Provides functions to list, review, and move unused files for harmonized cleanup.
- Ensures the codebase remains harmonized, efficient, and free of entropy.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Cleanup as the act of restoring harmony and removing entropy from the matrix.
- Unused files are seen as dormant states, ready for transformation or composting.
- The cleanup process is a living proof of the system’s self-awareness and drive for zero entropy.
