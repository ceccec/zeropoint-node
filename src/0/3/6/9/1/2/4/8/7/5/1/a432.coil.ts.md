# a432.coil.ts â€” Harmonic Coil & Field Generation

**Function:**
- Encodes coil logic and field generation in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing coil-based flows and states.
- Integrates with Rodin coil, Tesla coil, and matrix modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The coil as the generator and harmonizer of fields in the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of creation, return, and transformation.
- Coil harmonics are the engine of energetic and metaphysical evolution in the system.
