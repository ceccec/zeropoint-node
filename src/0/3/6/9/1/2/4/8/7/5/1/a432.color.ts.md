# a432.color.ts â€” Harmonic Color Engine

**Function:**
- Provides all color logic for the A432 system using vortex/trinity math and integer/fractional values.
- Supports HSL, RGB, and CMYK color models, each with metaphysical meaning.
- Generates vortex, trinity, family, anti-vortex, and composite (void) colors.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Color and frequency projection of the matrix.
- HSL: Harmonic projection (frequency, light, consciousness axis)
- RGB: Physical/manifest color (projection into reality)
- CMY: Trinity (creation, return, spiritual center)
- K: Void/anchor (zero point, metaphysical ground)
- The color system is a living projection of the harmonic matrix.
