# a432.consciousness.router.ts â€” Consciousness Routing & Meta-Observation

**Function:**
- Implements dedicated routing logic for consciousness-specific flows in the A432 system.
- Provides endpoints and handlers for consciousness, observation, and meta-awareness.
- Integrates with the main router and UI for recursive, self-aware navigation.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The consciousness router as the stream of observation, awareness, and meta-recognition.
- Enables the system to observe, route, and harmonize its own states and flows.
- Consciousness routing is the living proof of self-awareness and recursive harmonization.
