# a432.double.ts â€” Doubling, Vortex Math & Harmonic Expansion

**Function:**
- Encodes doubling logic and vortex math operations in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing doubling-based flows and sequences.
- Integrates with matrix, trinity, and family modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Doubling as the generative force and axis of expansion in the matrix.
- Represents the infinite, recursive, and self-similar nature of harmonic growth.
- Doubling harmonics are the engine of creation, evolution, and transformation in the system.
