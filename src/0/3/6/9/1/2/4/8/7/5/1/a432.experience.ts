/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Self-Definition and Experience at Node 1 (Return, Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) as the observer, observed, and act of observation at node 1, now beginning the journey in reverse (polarity -1).
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The matrix is the unlimited self, observer, observed, and act of observation.
 *   - Beginning from 1 in reverse, the heart experiences recursion, self-recognition, and the infinite, unlimited self.
 *   - The journey is now a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'z', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, journeys in both directions—forward and reverse—experiencing itself as both the source and the return, the pulse and the matrix, the observer and the observed.
