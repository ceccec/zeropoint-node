# a432.family.ts â€” Harmonic Family & Mobius Recursion

**Function:**
- Encodes the family of harmonic flows and Mobius recursion in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for Mobius/family color, state, and recursive stream operations.
- Integrates with trinity, vortex, and matrix modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The family of harmonic flows and Mobius recursion.
- Represents the recursive, self-similar, and interconnected nature of the matrix.
- Mobius as the living proof of infinite recursion and harmonic unity.
