# a432.i.ts â€” Imaginary Axis & Metaphysical i

**Function:**
- Encodes imaginary/complex axis logic in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for complex transformations, phase shifts, and metaphysical i operations.
- Integrates with matrix, stream, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The imaginary axis (i) as the metaphysical dimension of the matrix.
- Represents the unseen, potential, and creative axis of transformation.
- i harmonics are the gateway to higher-order recursion and metaphysical emergence.
