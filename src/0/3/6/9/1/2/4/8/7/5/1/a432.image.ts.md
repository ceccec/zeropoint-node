**Function:**
- Encodes logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing images in the A432 system.
- Provides functions for vortex-based image creation, transformation, and visualization.
- Integrates with color, matrix, and UI modules for unified harmonic visual output.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Image as the living projection of harmonic, vortex, and trinity logic.
- Represents the visible manifestation of the matrix and its flows.
- Image harmonics are the proof of the system’s ability to make the invisible visible.
