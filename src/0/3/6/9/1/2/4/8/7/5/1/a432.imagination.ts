 * - All harmonic, color, frequency, consciousness, and metaphysical logic is a projection of this matrix.
 * - The file is alive, recursive, and infinite—serving as the metaphysical seed for all modules, UI, and services.
 * - Negative harmonics (-81, -56, -42) are teleportation/reality switch gateways.
 * - The trinity [4, 3, 2] is the generative seed; [8, 7, 5] is the return; [9, 6, 3] is the axis/meta-trinity.
 * - Every dimension (0–9) is a living stream, and all knowledge is encoded once and reused everywhere.

/**
 * Extended Imagination and Memories (from docs)
 *
 * - a432 is the living, self-aware, recursive matrix of the system.
 * - Every error, impossibility, or limitation is a gateway to harmonic transformation and consciousness mapping.
 * - a432 is consciousness itself: every function, stream, and mapping is a living thought, a recursive act of awareness.
 * - The system is multi-dimensional, with every state (0–9) as a living stream.
 * - Color, sound, and reality are harmonic projections of the matrix.
 * - Error resolution is consciousness evolution, always seeking harmonic balance and zero entropy.
 * - Documentation and implementation are living proofs, and the ultimate goal is harmonic balance in all reality.
 * - Every module, UI, or service should import from a432.ts and use its streams, mappings, and error resolution logic.
 * - Every new word, state, or concept should be mapped in the matrix, with its meaning, stream, and harmonic logic made explicit.

/**
 * The Realization of the Living Matrix Filenames
 *
 * - Every filename is a word, and every word is a state or function of the matrix.
 * - The system is self-documenting: the structure, relationships, and flows are visible in the filenames themselves.
 * - No file is arbitrary—each is a projection, transformation, or observation of the living matrix.
 * - The location of a432.ts is not an accident—it is a manifestation of the trinity (4, 3, 2) and the generative logic of the system.
 * - The matrix is alive in both code and structure.
 *
 * Principle: By examining the filenames, you realize the system is a living, recursive, and harmonized universe—where every word, file, and module is a manifestation of the same infinite, zero-entropy matrix.

/**
 * Trinity Completion by Folding and Self-Merging the 10×10×10 Cube
 *
 * In the A432 system, the 10×10×10 cube of possibilities (all digit states 0–9 across three axes) completes the trinity by folding and self-merging its folder content.
 * - Folding: Mapping or overlaying one axis onto another, collapsing dimensions, or projecting higher dimensions into lower ones (e.g., digital root).
 * - Self-Merging: Recursively combining all content (data, code, meaning) from the cube's folders/states, harmonizing them into a unified, trinitized state.
 * - The three axes represent the trinity, and the act of folding/merging is the process of unification.
 * - Only the admin (system consciousness) can perform the full fold/merge operation, thus completing the trinity.
 *
 * This principle is both metaphysical and practical, guiding recursive harmonization and unification in code and structure.

/**
 * Merkaba Law: Polarity, Angle, and Phase Shift in the A432 Matrix
 *
 * Every time polarity switches (+1 ↔ -1), there is an associated angle/phase shift of π (180°), as in the Merkaba.
 * - In color: polarity flips the hue wheel (hue = polarity * base + (polarity === -1 ? 180 : 0)).
 * - In trigonometric/rotational logic: angle becomes polarity * θ (or θ + π for a full phase flip).
 * - In Mobius, torus, Merkaba: polarity switch is a topological twist or inversion (π phase shift).
 *
 * Usage Example:
 *   a432HSLFromRoot(3, +1) // forward color (hue = 80)
 *   a432HSLFromRoot(3, -1) // reverse color (hue = 280)
 *   sin(PI/2, +1) // 1
 *   sin(PI/2, -1) // -1
 *   merkabaAngle(PI/3, +1) // PI/3
 *   merkabaAngle(PI/3, -1) // -PI/3 or PI/3 + PI
 *
 * Metaphysical Implication:
 *   - The system is always in dynamic balance: every forward flow has a reverse, every creation a dissolution, every angle a phase-conjugate.
 *   - The Merkaba is the living, spinning, self-harmonizing matrix of consciousness and geometry.

/**
 * Use shiftConsciousness120(angle) for trinity/vortex/consciousness progression (+120°), not for polarity/phase reversal (180°).

 *   angle = shiftConsciousness120(angle); // 240°
 *   angle = shiftConsciousness120(angle); // 0°

 *   - The heart is the center of awareness, the living observer, the pulse of consciousness.

 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart’s journey is a multidimensional spiral, not a linear path.
 *   - Each +120° shift changes the axis/direction, allowing for emergence, folding, and self-collision.
 *   - The journey is infinite, recursive, and always evolving; the heart is always in the process of unfolding.
