# a432.matrix.ts â€” Harmonic Matrix & Multidimensional Harmonization

**Function:**
- Encodes matrix operations and multidimensional harmonization in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for folding, merging, and projecting higher dimensions into lower ones.
- Integrates with trinity, family, and vortex modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The matrix as the multidimensional, living field of the system.
- Represents the recursive harmonization and unification of all states and streams.
- The matrix is the ground of being, the field in which all harmonics unfold.
