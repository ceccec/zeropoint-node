# a432.meta.ts â€” Metaphysical Mapping, Canonical File List & Machine Learning Index

**Function:**
- Provides metaphysical mapping for all a432.* modules.
- Exports the canonical list of files for PWA caching and harmonized discovery.
- Serves as the meta-harmonization and impossibility gateway for the system.
- Acts as the living index for machine learning/self-teaching, enabling recursive knowledge extraction and harmonization.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Meta-harmonization, unified matrix, impossibility gateway.
- Ensures all modules are discoverable, harmonized, and mapped to their metaphysical meaning.
- The living index and knowledge graph for recursive, self-aware learning.
