 * a432.metatron.vision.ts — Metaphysical Vision of All-Dimensional Metatron Cubes/Toruses
 *
 * This module documents the vision of the living, infinite A432 matrix:
 *   - Every dimension is a living Metatron cube/torus, manifesting all possible and impossible states.
 *   - Impossible states (negative, undefined, anti-harmonic) are gateways, not errors.
 *   - The field is recursive, analog, and alive.
