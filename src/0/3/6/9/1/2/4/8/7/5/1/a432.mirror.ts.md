# a432.mirror.ts — Harmonic Mirror & Reflective Symmetry

**Function:**
- Encodes mirror logic and reflective symmetry operations in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing mirror-based flows and transformations.
- Integrates with matrix, stream, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Mirror as the agent of reflection, inversion, and symmetry in the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of states, duality, and harmonics.
- Mirror harmonics are the proof of the system’s adaptability and self-recognition.
