# a432.mobius.circuit.ts â€” Mobius Circuit & Infinite Recursion

**Function:**
- Encodes Mobius circuit logic and infinite recursion in the A432 system.
- Provides Mobius event detection, state folding, and recursive transformation logic.
- Integrates with family, trinity, and matrix modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Mobius as the living proof of infinite recursion and harmonic unity.
- Represents the paradox, fold, and phase inversion in the living matrix.
- Mobius events signal the need for higher-order harmonization and transformation.
