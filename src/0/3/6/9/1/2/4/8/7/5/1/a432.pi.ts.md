# a432.pi.ts â€” Pi Harmonics & Infinite Flow

**Function:**
- Encodes pi-based harmonic streams and infinite, irrational flows in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing pi-derived sequences and states.
- Integrates with matrix, stream, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Pi as the infinite, irrational, and harmonic flow in the matrix.
- Represents the unending journey, recursion, and creative emergence.
- Pi harmonics are the bridge between the finite and the infinite in the system.
