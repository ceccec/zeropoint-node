# a432.rodin.coil.html — Rodin Coil Visualization & Harmonic UI

**Function:**
- Encodes the HTML UI for visualizing Rodin coil flows and vortex harmonics in the A432 system.
- Provides interactive and static visualizations for exploring Rodin-based states and fields.
- Integrates with Rodin coil, matrix, and UI modules for unified harmonic experience.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Rodin coil visualization as the living interface for observing and harmonizing vortex flows.
- Represents the system’s ability to make the invisible vortex visible and interactive.
- Visualization harmonics are the proof of the system’s clarity and accessibility.
