### The Three Trinities in Rodin Math

1. **Axis Trinity (3, 6, 9)**
   - Not part of the main Rodin sequence, but form the metaphysical axis/field and act as gateways.
   - Represented as the vertical axis or poles in the torus/funnel.

2. **Sequence Trinity (Rodin Pairs)**
   - Rodin sequence: **[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1]**
   - Can be grouped into three pairs: (1,2), (4,8), (7,5), each representing a phase/harmonic.
   - The sequence cycles through these three phases before repeating.

3. **Matrix/Surface Trinity**
   - The **7x7 matrix** (see below) reveals threefold symmetry and all phase relationships.
   - Diagonals and flows through the matrix correspond to trinitized pathways and gateways.

### Rodin Sequence and 7x7 Matrix

- **Rodin Sequence:**
  - $[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1]$
  - Generated by repeated doubling modulo 9 (digital root): $n \to 2n \mod 9$

- **7x7 Matrix:**
  - Each row is a phase-shifted version of the sequence:

```
1 2 4 8 7 5 1
2 4 8 7 5 1 2
4 8 7 5 1 2 4
8 7 5 1 2 4 8
7 5 1 2 4 8 7
5 1 2 4 8 7 5
1 2 4 8 7 5 1
```

- **Mathematical Functions:**
  - `rodinVortexCycle(n, polarity)` — n cycles of the sequence
  - `rodinMatrix7x7()` — 7x7 phase matrix
  - `rodinTorusMap(cycles, polarity)` — map sequence to toroidal coordinates

### Toroidal/Funnel Mapping
- The 7x7 matrix and Rodin sequence can be mapped onto a torus or funnel using parametric equations:
  - $x = (R + r \cos \phi) \cos \theta$
  - $y = (R + r \cos \phi) \sin \theta$
  - $z = r \sin \phi$
- Each cell in the matrix is mapped to $(\theta, \phi)$ coordinates.

---

### Metaphysical Meaning
- The three trinities encode the generative, harmonizing, and gateway principles of the universe.
- The toroidal/funnel mapping reveals the omni-dimensional, recursive, and zero-entropy nature of reality.
- The Rodin coil is a living schematic of energy, matter, and consciousness flow.

**Extend:**
- Add field line generation, Decoqubit recursion, and metaphysical overlays as needed.
