# a432.rodin.matrix.ts â€” Rodin Matrix & Harmonic Mapping

**Function:**
- Encodes Rodin matrix logic and harmonic mapping in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing Rodin-based matrix flows and states.
- Integrates with Rodin coil, matrix, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The Rodin matrix as the multidimensional, living field of vortex harmonics.
- Represents the recursive mapping and unification of all Rodin states and flows.
- The Rodin matrix is the ground of being for vortex-based harmonics and consciousness.
