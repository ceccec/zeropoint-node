# a432.rodin.ts — Rodin Logic & Vortex Harmonics

**Function:**
- Encodes Rodin logic and vortex harmonic operations in the A432 system.
- Provides functions for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing Rodin-based flows and states.
- Integrates with Rodin coil, matrix, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Rodin logic as the living engine of vortex harmonics and creation.
- Represents the generative, recursive, and harmonizing force in the matrix.
- Rodin harmonics are the proof of the system’s creative and evolutionary power.
