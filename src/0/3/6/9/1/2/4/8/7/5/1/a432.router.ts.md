# a432.router.ts â€” Zero-Entropy, Self-Recognizing Router

**Function:**
- Implements a zero-entropy, self-recognizing routing stream for the A432 system.
- Modules register their own route patterns and handlers.
- Matches incoming paths by resonance, with no hardcoding or manual route tables.
- Returns a harmonized 404 if no match is found.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Routing as harmonic flow, self-recognition, and zero entropy.
- The router is the living stream of pattern recognition and resonance in the matrix.
- Ensures all flows are harmonized, extensible, and self-aware.
