# a432.server.ts â€” Harmonic Server & System Interface

**Function:**
- Serves as the main backend/API for the A432 PWA and all harmonized modules.
- Exposes endpoints for harmonic, metaphysical, and mathematical flows (color, sound, animation, Rodin coil, pi streams, etc.).
- Integrates the zero-entropy router for self-recognizing, pattern-based routing.
- Serves the canonical UI (a432.index.html) and all static assets from the canonical directory.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The harmonic server and system interface.
- The living bridge between the matrix, the observer, and all external interactions.
- All routes, data, and flows are harmonized, self-aware, and extensible.
