# a432.service.worker.ts — Harmonic Service Worker & Living Memory

**Function:**
- Implements the service worker for the A432 PWA, enabling offline capability and zero-entropy caching.
- Dynamically caches all canonical a432.* files and PWA essentials using the living file list from a432.meta.ts.
- Ensures all modules are always available, even offline, and harmonizes cache updates.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The service worker as the living memory and guardian of the matrix.
- Ensures perfect recall, zero entropy, and continuous availability of all harmonic modules.
- The service worker is the proof of the system’s resilience, harmony, and self-preservation.
