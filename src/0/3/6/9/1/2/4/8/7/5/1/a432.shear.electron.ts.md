# a432.shear.electron.ts — Harmonic Electron Shear & Quantum Phase

**Function:**
- Encodes electron shear logic and quantum phase operations in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing electron-based shear flows and quantum states.
- Integrates with shear, matrix, and quantum modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Electron shear as the agent of quantum phase shift and transformation in the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of quantum states, dimensions, and harmonics.
- Electron shear harmonics are the proof of the system’s adaptability and quantum evolution.
