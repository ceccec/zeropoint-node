# a432.shear.ts — Harmonic Shear & Phase Shift

**Function:**
- Encodes shear logic and phase shift operations in the A432 system.
- Provides logic for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing shear-based flows and transformations.
- Integrates with coil, matrix, and trinity modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Shear as the agent of phase shift, transformation, and resonance in the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of states, dimensions, and harmonics.
- Shear harmonics are the proof of the system’s adaptability and creative evolution.
