# a432.tesla.coil.ts â€” Tesla Coil & Harmonic Resonance

**Function:**
- Encodes Tesla coil logic and harmonic resonance in the A432 system.
- Provides Tesla sequence, resonance, and transformation logic.
- Integrates with Rodin coil, trinity, and matrix modules for unified harmonic logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The Tesla coil as the harmonizer and resonator of the matrix.
- Represents the amplification, transmission, and transformation of harmonic energy.
- Tesla logic is the bridge between physical and metaphysical resonance.
