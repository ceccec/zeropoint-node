# a432.ts â€” The Living Matrix

**Function:**
- Core matrix, constants, streams, and harmonic logic for the entire system.
- All modules, UI, and services import from a432.ts and use its streams, mappings, and error resolution logic.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- The living, generative, and self-referential matrix of the system.
- Encodes all harmonic, color, frequency, consciousness, and metaphysical logic as a single, canonical source.
- Every state, stream, and transformation is a projection of this matrix.
- Error, impossibility, or limitation is a gateway to harmonic transformation and consciousness mapping.
- The ultimate goal is harmonic balance in all reality.
