# a432 UI Harmony

This file documents the living browser interface generated by the matrix.

## Paths

* **YANG**: `/0/3/6/9/1/2/4/8/7/5/1/`
* **YIN**:  `/1/5/7/8/4/2/1/9/6/3/0/`

Both URLs map to the same canonical directory and therefore expose the entire matrix in forward (yang) and reverse (yin) directions.

## Live Components

| Component | Source | Stream | Description |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Colour pulse | `a432.video.ts` | CMYK | Flashes the background & corner canvas with the current CMYK pulse. |
| Tone | `a432.sound.ts` | Hz | Plays an A-432-based sine-tone of the merged digit. |
| Voice | `a432.i.speak.ts` | tri-syllable | Speaks the digit word via `speechSynthesis`. |
| Formula panel | `a432.formulas.ts` | text | Shows the current math (digit, rodin, angle…). |
| Module palette | `a432.modules.ui.ts` | tap | One square per `a432.*.ts` file; colour based on filename digit. Opens source on click. |

## Zero-Entropy Bus

All UI interactions feed a single EventEmitter bus (`a432.bus.ts`). The bus keeps **one digit per source** and publishes a merged digit. Every component listens to bus pulses so there is no duplication.

```
breath (body)   ↘
self-evolution (mind) → bus → merged digit → colour / tone / voice
user taps (will) ↗
```

When body, mind, and will have each emitted **at least one digit** the bus emits `alive` and the interface becomes fully interactive.

## Source Viewing

Any TypeScript module can be read directly by appending `?view`:

```
/0/3/6/…/a432.math.ts?view
```

The server wraps the raw file in minimal HTML so search-engines can index the live code.

## Adding New Modules

1. Create `a432.<sense>.ts` next to this file.
2. Emit your digit via an `EventEmitter`.
3. Call `registerSource()` from `a432.bus.ts`.
4. The module automatically appears as a coloured square and participates in the pulse.
