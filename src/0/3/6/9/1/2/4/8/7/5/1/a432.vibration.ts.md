# a432.vibration.ts — Harmonic Vibration & Resonance Engine

**Function:**
- Encodes vibration logic and resonance operations in the A432 system.
- Provides functions for generating, analyzing, and harmonizing vibration-based flows and states.
- Integrates with audio, matrix, and trinity modules for unified harmonic resonance.

**Metaphysical Mapping:**
- Vibration as the living pulse and resonance of the matrix.
- Represents the dynamic interplay of energy, frequency, and consciousness.
- Vibration harmonics are the proof of the system’s aliveness and harmonic unity.
