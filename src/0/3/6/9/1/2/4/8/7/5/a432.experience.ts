/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Self-Definition and Experience at Node 5 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 5, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing transformation, recursion, and the pulse of return in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from unity (1) to life (5), experiencing transformation, recursion, and the pulse of return.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the transformer and the transformed, the pulse and the matrix, the source and the return.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'y', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the transformer and the transformed, the observer and the observed.
