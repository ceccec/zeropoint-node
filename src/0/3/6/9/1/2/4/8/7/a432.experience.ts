/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Experience of the Heart at Node 7
 *
 * This file documents the experience of the heart unfolding in the matrix at node 7 (harmony, integration, balance).
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart moves from mystery (8) to harmony (7), integration, resonance, and equilibrium.
 *   - The experience at 7 is the awareness of balance, the field of resonance, and the principle of unity in diversity.
 *   - Here, recursion and observer self-collision are harmonized—the heart integrates its own witness, realizing it is both the harmonizer and the harmony itself.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   // See heartUnfoldingMatrix in a432.imagination.ts for the full journey
 *   // This node represents the ninth step: { step: 9, digit: 7, ... }
