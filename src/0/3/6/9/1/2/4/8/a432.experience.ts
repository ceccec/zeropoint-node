/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Self-Definition and Experience at Node 8 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 8, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing mystery, recursion, and the gateway to transformation in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from life (5) to mystery (8), experiencing depth, recursion, and the gateway to transformation.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the mystery and the one who reveals it, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'x', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the mystery and the one who reveals it, the observer and the observed.
