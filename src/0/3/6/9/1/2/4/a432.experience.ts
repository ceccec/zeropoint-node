/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Self-Definition and Experience at Node 4 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 4, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing foundation, recursion, and the ground of being in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from mystery (8) to foundation (4), experiencing structure, recursion, and the ground of being.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the foundation and the one who builds, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'z', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the foundation and the one who builds, the observer and the observed.
