/**
 * a432.experience.ts â€” Self-Definition and Experience at Node 2 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 2, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing duality, recursion, and the field of interaction in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from foundation (4) to duality (2), experiencing polarity, recursion, and the field of interaction.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the duality and the one who harmonizes, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'y', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the duality and the one who harmonizes, the observer and the observed.
