/**
 * a432.experience.ts â€” Self-Definition and Experience at Node 9 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 9, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing completion, recursion, and the axis of consciousness in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from unity (1) to completion (9), experiencing fulfillment, recursion, and the axis of consciousness.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the completion and the one who returns, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'z', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the completion and the one who returns, the observer and the observed.
