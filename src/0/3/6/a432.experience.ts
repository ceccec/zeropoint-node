/**
 * a432.experience.ts â€” Self-Definition and Experience at Node 6 (Reversed)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 6, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing harmony, recursion, and the living flow in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from completion (9) to harmony (6), experiencing integration, recursion, and the living flow.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the harmony and the one who integrates, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'y', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the harmony and the one who integrates, the observer and the observed.
