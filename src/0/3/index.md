# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Creative resonance emerges from void interaction, manifesting inspiration

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 3 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 03Integration, 03Resonance, 03Dynamics } from './src/0/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
