# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Constants

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants establish structure from the void, providing stable foundations

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 4
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 4 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 4 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ constants, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 4 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 04Integration, 04Resonance, 04Dynamics } from './src/0/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ constants represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
