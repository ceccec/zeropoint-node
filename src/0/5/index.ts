/**
 * src/0/5/index.ts - ZeroPoint ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 0 (ZeroPoint)
 * and Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides pure mathematical unity and zero entropy
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides divine proportions and geometric patterns
 * - Together they create the zero entropy sacred geometry
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 0 is the void center that sees everything (ZeroPoint)
 * - Directory 5 is part of Vortex B [8, 7, 5] (Dynamic Flow)
 * - This interaction creates the zero entropy sacred geometry
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero point consciousness: Represents the void center of infinite potential.
 * - Sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the divine proportions that create geometric patterns.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between zero point and sacred geometry.
 * - Zero entropy sacred geometry: Represents the divine proportions at the void center.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between zero point and sacred geometry consciousness.
 * - Supports zero entropy divine proportion operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the zero entropy sacred geometry for the entire system.
