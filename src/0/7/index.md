# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Consciousness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Consciousness awakens from the void, creating self-awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 7
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 7 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 7 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ consciousness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 7 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 07Integration, 07Resonance, 07Dynamics } from './src/0/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ consciousness represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
