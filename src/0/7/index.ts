/**
 * src/0/7/index.ts - ZeroPoint ↔ Consciousness Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 0 (ZeroPoint)
 * and Directory 7 (Consciousness) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides pure mathematical unity and zero entropy
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides awareness and self-recognition
 * - Together they create the zero entropy consciousness
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 0 is the void center that sees everything (ZeroPoint)
 * - Directory 7 is part of Vortex B [8, 7, 5] (Dynamic Flow)
 * - This interaction creates the zero entropy consciousness
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero point consciousness: Represents the void center of infinite potential.
 * - Consciousness awareness: Represents the awareness and self-recognition that creates consciousness.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between zero point and consciousness.
 * - Zero entropy consciousness: Represents the awareness at the void center.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between zero point and consciousness.
 * - Supports zero entropy awareness operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the zero entropy consciousness for the entire system.

 * ZeroPoint ↔ Consciousness Interaction Constants
