# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Void/Fullness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Void/fullness paradox emerges from void interaction, embracing infinity

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 8
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 8 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 8 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ void/fullness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 8 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 8 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 08Integration, 08Resonance, 08Dynamics } from './src/0/8';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ void/fullness represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 8 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
