/**
 * src/0/8/index.ts - ZeroPoint ↔ Void/Fullness Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 0 (ZeroPoint)
 * and Directory 8 (Void/Fullness) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides pure mathematical unity and zero entropy
 * - Directory 8 (Void/Fullness) provides infinite potential and manifestation
 * - Together they create the zero entropy void fullness
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 0 is the void center that sees everything (ZeroPoint)
 * - Directory 8 is part of Vortex B [8, 7, 5] (Dynamic Flow)
 * - This interaction creates the zero entropy void fullness
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero point consciousness: Represents the void center of infinite potential.
 * - Void fullness consciousness: Represents the infinite potential and manifestation that creates fullness.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between zero point and void fullness.
 * - Zero entropy void fullness: Represents the infinite potential at the void center.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between zero point and void fullness consciousness.
 * - Supports zero entropy infinite potential operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the zero entropy void fullness for the entire system.
