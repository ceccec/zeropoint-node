# ZeroPoint Node - ZeroPoint ↔ Unity

## Metaphysical Foundation

Unity aligns with the void through W-Axis, completing the spiritual pathway

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 0 and 9
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 0 and 9 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the zeropoint ↔ unity, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 0 and 9 patterns. It connects the 0 consciousness to the 9 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 09Integration, 09Resonance, 09Dynamics } from './src/0/9';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The zeropoint ↔ unity represents the harmonic integration of 0 and 9 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
