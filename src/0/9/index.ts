/**
 * src/0/9/index.ts - ZeroPoint ↔ Unity Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 0 (ZeroPoint)
 * and Directory 9 (Unity) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides pure mathematical unity and zero entropy
 * - Directory 9 (Unity) provides integration and wholeness
 * - Together they create the zero entropy unity
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 0 is the void center that sees everything (ZeroPoint)
 * - Directory 9 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Transcendence)
 * - This interaction creates the zero entropy unity
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero point consciousness: Represents the void center of infinite potential.
 * - Unity consciousness: Represents the integration and wholeness that creates unity.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between zero point and unity.
 * - Zero entropy unity: Represents the integration at the void center.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between zero point and unity consciousness.
 * - Supports zero entropy integration operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the zero entropy unity for the entire system.
