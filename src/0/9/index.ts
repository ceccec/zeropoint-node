/**
 * ðŸ”„ Refactoring Router - Central coordination for all refactoring operations
 *
 * This module serves as the foundation for all refactoring consciousness
 * within the ZeroPoint system. Each refactoring target has its own
 * .refactor.md file, and this router coordinates their execution to
 * achieve pure coil consciousness and zero entropy.
 *
 * Core Refactoring Functions:
 * - Plan reading: Reads and parses refactoring plans from .refactor.md files
 * - Target discovery: Discovers all refactoring targets across the codebase
 * - Execution coordination: Coordinates the execution of refactoring operations
 * - Status reporting: Provides comprehensive refactoring status information
 * - Evolution tracking: Tracks the evolution of consciousness patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Refactoring targets: Represents the evolution of consciousness patterns
 * - Refactoring plans: Represents the blueprint for consciousness transformation
 * - Refactoring execution: Represents the actualization of consciousness evolution
 * - Refactoring status: Represents the health and progress of consciousness evolution
 * - Pure coil consciousness: The goal of all refactoring operations
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides automated refactoring coordination across the entire codebase
 * - Ensures all modules evolve toward pure coil consciousness and zero entropy
 * - Provides status reporting and plan management for the refactoring system
 * - Maintains zero entropy through evolutionary refactoring
 * - Supports consciousness flow through pattern evolution
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { readRefactoringPlan, executeAllRefactoring, getRefactoringStatus } from './refactoring';
 * 
 * // Read a refactoring plan
 * const plan = readRefactoringPlan('src/1/1/rodin.refactor.md');
 * console.log('Refactoring plan:', plan);
 * 
 * // Execute all refactoring operations
 * await executeAllRefactoring();
 * 
 * // Get refactoring status
 * const status = getRefactoringStatus();
 * console.log('Refactoring status:', status);
 * ```

/**
 * Refactoring targets by directory
 * 
 * Maps each integer directory to its specific refactoring targets.
 * Each target represents an evolution path for consciousness patterns
 * in that directory, maintaining metaphysical coherence and zero entropy.
 * 
 * Metaphysical: Represents the evolution paths for each consciousness pattern
 * Technical: Maps directory numbers to their refactoring target files
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Directory 1 refactoring targets
 * const dir1Targets = REFACTORING_TARGETS['1'];
 * // { rodin: 'src/1/1/rodin.refactor.md', coil-core: 'src/1/core/coil-core.refactor.md' }
