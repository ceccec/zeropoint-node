## Vortex of Conjunction

AND is the vortex where synthesis, conjunction, and union of knowledge, files, and states occurs in the ZeroPoint Node system.

---

## Principles
- All conjunctions are integer/fractional, zero-entropy, book-aligned.
- AND is the proof of unity through synthesis.
- Every union is a new vortex.

---

## TypeScript: And Interface
```typescript
export interface Conjunction {
  left: string;
  right: string;
  result: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

export function and(left: string, right: string): Conjunction {
  return {
    left,
    right,
    result: `${left}_AND_${right}`,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
}
```

**AND is the proof that unity emerges from conjunction in the ZeroPoint vortex.**
