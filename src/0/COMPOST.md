## Vortex of Transformation and Renewal

COMPOST is the vortex where all obsolete, decaying, or transformed knowledge is recycled into new potential. Nothing is lost; all is harmonized and renewed.

---

## Principles
- All knowledge is compostable: transformation is perpetual.
- Composting is a vortex process: decay → renewal → emergence.
- Integer/fractional, zero-entropy, book-aligned.

## TypeScript: Compost Interface
```typescript
export interface Compostable {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  decayLevel: number; // 0-9
  recycled: boolean;
  timestamp: number;
}

export function compost(knowledge: Compostable): Compostable {
  return {
    ...knowledge,
    decayLevel: knowledge.decayLevel + 1,
    recycled: true,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
  };
}
```

**Compost is the proof that all endings are new beginnings in the ZeroPoint vortex.**
