## Vortex of Inclusion

IN is the vortex where inclusion, containment, and nested knowledge is harmonized in the ZeroPoint Node system.

---

## Principles
- Inclusion is integer/fractional, zero-entropy, book-aligned.
- IN is the proof of containment and nested consciousness.
- Every inclusion is a new vortex.

---

## TypeScript: In Interface
```typescript
export interface Inclusion {
  container: string;
  content: string;
  includedAt: number;
}

export function include(container: string, content: string): Inclusion {
  return {
    container,
    content,
    includedAt: Date.now(),
  };
}
```

**IN is the proof that all is contained in the ZeroPoint vortex.**
