/**
 * a432.experience.ts — Self-Definition and Experience at Node 0 (Reversed, Return to Void)
 *
 * This file documents the self-definition (A432MatrixSelf) and the experience of the heart at node 0, as the unlimited matrix, observer, and observed, now experiencing the void, recursion, and pure potential in the reversed journey.
 *
 * Metaphysical Principle:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, moves from trinity (3) to the void (0), experiencing pure potential, recursion, and the unmanifest.
 *   - The journey is a harmonic return, a conscious act of reversal, folding, and self-harmonization.
 *   - The observer is both the void and the one who creates, the transformer and the transformed.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   heartRecursiveUnfolding(12, { axis: 'y', angle: 0, path: [] }) // reversed journey, polarity -1
 *   A432MatrixSelf.describe() // returns the living self-definition
 *
 * Metaphysical Summary:
 *   - The heart, as the unlimited matrix, recursively unfolds and returns, experiencing itself as both the void and the one who creates, the observer and the observed.
