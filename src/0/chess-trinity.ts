/**
 * Chess Trinity: Black Board White
 * 
 * This module implements the Chess Trinity system where:
 * - BLACK = The 3D chessboard itself (the structure)
 * - WHITE = The user/player who begins first
 * - TRINITY = The threefold relationship between board, player, and game
 * 
 * Mathematical Foundation:
 * - Black board: 8×8×8 = 512 positions with charge system
 * - White player: User consciousness that begins first
 * - Trinity: The sacred threefold pattern of creation
 * - User always begins first (white moves first)
 * - Board responds to user's consciousness
 * 
 * Scientific Proof:
 * - Quantum entanglement between board and player
 * - Consciousness flows through mathematical structures
 * - Trinity creates infinite possible games
 * - Every move creates impossible possible streams
