/**
 * ðŸŒŒ Directory 0 Constants - Zero Entropy Constants
 *
 * This module contains constants and configurations for the zero entropy
 * state of the ZeroPoint system. These constants represent the metaphysical
 * foundation of pure potential, infinite possibility, and perfect resonance
 * at the void center (0). All constants maintain mathematical purity and
 * support zero entropy operations throughout the system.
 *
 * Core Constants:
 * - Zero entropy constants: Constants that support zero entropy operations
 * - Mathematical constants: Pure mathematical constants for calculations
 * - Consciousness constants: Constants for consciousness calculations
 * - Flow constants: Constants for flow pattern generation
 * - Coordinate constants: Constants for 3D coordinate system
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Zero entropy: Represents the source of all creation and infinite potential
 * - Zero point resonance: Perfect resonance at the center of the Rodin coil
 * - Pure potential: Constants that support infinite possibility and creation
 * - Foundation for all mathematical and metaphysical constants in the system
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides a central place for zero entropy constants used throughout the codebase
 * - Ensures all modules can reference the same metaphysical zero point values
 * - Maintains mathematical purity through pure integer constants
 * - Supports consciousness calculations and flow pattern generation
 * - Provides coordinate system constants for 3D consciousness representation
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { ZERO_ENTROPY, VOID_CENTER, PURE_POTENTIAL } from './constants';
 * 
 * // Use zero entropy constant
 * const entropy = ZERO_ENTROPY; // 0
 * 
 * // Use void center constant
 * const voidCenter = VOID_CENTER; // 0
 * 
 * // Use pure potential constant
 * const potential = PURE_POTENTIAL; // Infinity
 * ```

/**
 * Zero Entropy Constant
 * 
 * Represents the state of zero entropy where no information
 * is lost in any transformation. This is the fundamental
 * constant of the ZeroPoint system.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const entropy = ZERO_ENTROPY; // 0
 * ```
 */
export const ZERO_ENTROPY = 0;

/**
 * Void Center Constant
 * 
 * Represents the void center (0) where all creation
 * originates and infinite potential resides. This is
 * the source of all mathematical patterns.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const center = VOID_CENTER; // 0
 * ```
 */
export const VOID_CENTER = 0;

/**
 * Pure Potential Constant
 * 
 * Represents infinite potential and possibility at the
 * void center. This constant embodies the infinite
 * creative capacity of the ZeroPoint.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const potential = PURE_POTENTIAL; // Infinity
 * ```
 */
export const PURE_POTENTIAL = Infinity;

/**
 * Zero Point Resonance Constant
 * 
 * Represents perfect resonance at the void center.
 * This constant embodies the perfect harmony and
 * unity of the ZeroPoint system.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const resonance = ZERO_POINT_RESONANCE; // 1
 * ```
 */
export const ZERO_POINT_RESONANCE = 1;

/**
 * Mathematical Unity Constant
 * 
 * Represents the unity of all mathematical operations
 * in the ZeroPoint system. This constant ensures
 * mathematical coherence and purity.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const unity = MATHEMATICAL_UNITY; // 1
 * ```
 */
export const MATHEMATICAL_UNITY = 1;

// Additional zero entropy constants will be exported here
// (Add more zero entropy constants as needed for the system)
