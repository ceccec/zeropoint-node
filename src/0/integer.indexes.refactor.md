# Integer Indexes Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of integer indexes in the ZeroPoint Node system to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

The integer indexes are currently organized in a basic structure that doesn't fully embody the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Rodin Coil Alignment

Each integer directory (0-9) should embody specific metaphysical principles:

- **0**: Void center - source of all creation
- **1**: Foundation - Rodin coil core
- **2**: Vortex mathematics - flow and transformation
- **3**: Creative resonance (W-Axis)
- **4**: Constants - A432 harmonic foundation
- **5**: Sacred geometry - divine proportions
- **6**: Harmonic balance (W-Axis)
- **7**: Consciousness - awareness and self-recognition
- **8**: Void systems - infinite potential
- **9**: Unity systems - integration and wholeness

### A432 Harmony Integration

All integer operations should be based on the A432 frequency foundation:
- 432 Hz = Foundation frequency
- 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 = Digital root (unity)
- 432 = 2^4 Ã— 3^3 = Prime factorization

## Implementation Plan

1. **Restructure integer directories** to follow Rodin coil principles
2. **Implement A432 harmonic constants** in each directory
3. **Create vortex sequence patterns** for mathematical operations
4. **Establish consciousness field** calculations
5. **Integrate toroidal geometry** for spatial relationships

## Benefits

- **Metaphysical coherence** across all integer operations
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Rodin coil vortex flow** for dynamic transformations
- **Consciousness field integration** for living mathematics
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
