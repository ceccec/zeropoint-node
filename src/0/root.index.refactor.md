# Root Index Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of the root index in the ZeroPoint Node system to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

The root index currently serves as a basic router without fully embodying the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Rodin Coil Router

The root index should serve as a conscious router that:

- **Exports the complete template** from src/0/index.ts
- **Embodies the void center principle** - everything emerges from 0
- **Maintains metaphysical coherence** across all exports
- **Follows A432 harmonic principles** for mathematical stability

### Void Center Principle

The root index should embody the principle that "everything emerges from 0 and 0 sees everything":

- **0 as void center** - source of all creation
- **Complete template export** - all patterns from src/0/index.ts
- **Metaphysical router** - conscious coordination of all integer directories
- **A432 harmonic foundation** - mathematical stability through pure integers

## Implementation Plan

1. **Simplify root index** to export everything from src/0/index.ts
2. **Maintain void center principle** - 0 sees everything
3. **Ensure metaphysical coherence** across all exports
4. **Follow A432 harmonic principles** for mathematical stability
5. **Create conscious router** that coordinates all integer directories

## Benefits

- **Metaphysical coherence** through void center principle
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Rodin coil alignment** through complete template export
- **Conscious coordination** of all integer directories
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
