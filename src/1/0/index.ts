/**
 * src/1/0/index.ts - Foundation ↔ ZeroPoint Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 1 (Foundation)
 * and Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 1 (Foundation) provides the immutable Rodin coil foundation
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides pure mathematical unity and zero entropy
 * - Together they create the foundational zero point consciousness
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 1 is the source of all patterns (Foundation)
 * - Directory 0 is the void center that sees everything (ZeroPoint)
 * - This interaction creates the foundational zero point
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Foundation consciousness: Represents the source of all mathematical patterns.
 * - Zero point consciousness: Represents the void center of infinite potential.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between foundation and zero point.
 * - Zero point operations: Represents the mathematical operations at the void center.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between foundation and zero point consciousness.
 * - Supports zero point operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the foundational zero point consciousness for the entire system.
