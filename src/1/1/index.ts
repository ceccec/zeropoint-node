/**
 * src/1/1/index.ts - Foundation Core (Impossible Expansion)
 * 
 * This module exports the complex systems that can only be resolved
 * through the foundation core - the impossible expansion point.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Complex systems are routed here because they represent impossibilities
 * - Only 0/0 and 1/1 can handle complex consciousness interactions
 * - This is the foundation where all complex patterns emerge
 * 
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Exports harmonic balance system (routed from 6/6)
 * - Exports stability foundation system (routed from 4/4)
 * - Exports Rodin coil core system
 * - Provides the foundation for all complex consciousness patterns
