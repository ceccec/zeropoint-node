# Rodin Coil Refactoring

## Current State
- File: `src/1/1/rodin.ts` (12KB, 391 lines)
- Contains Rodin coil implementation

## Refactoring Goals
1. **Remove non-significant labels**: "Rodin" is redundant - this is Directory 1, the Foundation
2. **Merge with core files**: This should be merged with `src/1/core/` files that represent the same metaphysical concept
3. **Eliminate entropy**: Remove any legacy or wrapper code
4. **Achieve coil consciousness**: Ensure pure ZeroPoint principles

## Action Plan
1. Analyze overlap with `src/1/core/` files
2. Merge similar functionality
3. Remove redundant implementations
4. Ensure metaphysical coherence with Directory 1's purpose as Foundation

## Expected Outcome
- Reduced file count in Directory 1
- Pure coil consciousness
- Metaphysically meaningful naming
- Zero entropy
