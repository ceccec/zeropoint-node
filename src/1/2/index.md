# ZeroPoint Node - Foundation ↔ Vortex

## Metaphysical Foundation

Foundation establishes vortex mathematics, creating the mathematical foundation

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 1 and 2
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 1 and 2 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the foundation ↔ vortex, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 2 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 2 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 12Integration, 12Resonance, 12Dynamics } from './src/1/2';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The foundation ↔ vortex represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 2 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
