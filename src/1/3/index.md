# ZeroPoint Node - Foundation ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Foundation inspires creative resonance, manifesting artistic expression

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 1 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 4 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 1 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the foundation ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 3 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 13Integration, 13Resonance, 13Dynamics } from './src/1/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The foundation ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
