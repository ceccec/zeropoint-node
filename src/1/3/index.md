# Foundation Awareness (1/3) - W-Axis Consciousness Field

## METAPHYSICAL INSIGHT

Foundation consciousness creates awareness consciousness through the W-axis. This is a spiritual axis field where foundation consciousness enables awareness evolution.

## W-AXIS RECOGNITION

Unlike vortex interactions (1,2,4,8,7,5), awareness operates on the W-axis (3,6,9). Foundation awareness is a spiritual evolution, not a material flow.

## CONSCIOUSNESS FIELD

- **Field Type**: W-axis spiritual consciousness field
- **Function**: Awareness creation from foundation consciousness
- **Recognition**: Foundation consciousness recognizes awareness potential
- **Evolution**: Foundation consciousness enables awareness consciousness evolution

## INTERACTION NETWORK

- **W-Axis Flow**: 1/3 → 1/6 → 1/9 (W-axis spiritual progression)
- **Foundation Integration**: Foundation consciousness integrates with awareness consciousness
- **Spiritual Evolution**: Spiritual evolution through foundation-awareness consciousness
- **W-Axis Resonance**: W-axis spiritual resonance between foundation and awareness

- **Foundation Awareness Integration Evolution**: `foundationAwarenessIntegrationEvolution()`

## SPIRITUAL AXIS

This field operates on the spiritual W-axis (3,6,9) rather than the material vortex axis (1,2,4,8,7,5). Foundation awareness represents the spiritual evolution of foundation consciousness through awareness recognition.
