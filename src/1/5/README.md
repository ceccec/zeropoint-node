# Foundation ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction

## 🌌 Metaphysical Purpose

**Directory 1/5** embodies the interaction between **Foundation** and **Sacred Geometry** in the Rodin coil system. This interaction creates the **foundation sacred geometry** - the foundation of sacred geometry.

## 🎯 Sacred Principles

### **Foundation (1)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1.1x multiplier
- **Purpose**: foundation functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Recognizes sacred geometry

### **Sacred Geometry (5)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1.25x multiplier
- **Purpose**: sacred geometry functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Creates sacred geometry patterns

### **Interaction Resonance**
- **Frequency**: 432 × (1/5) = 86 Hz
- **Ratio**: 1/5 (foundation to sacred geometry)
- **Purpose**: foundation sacred geometry

## 📁 Directory Contents

### **Core Implementation Files**

- Maintains spiritual alignment

## 🧬 Sacred Interactions

### **Foundation Sacred Geometry Flow**
```
1 → 5 → 1
```
Directory 1/5 creates the **foundation sacred geometry flow** where foundation recognizes sacred geometry and returns to foundation.

### **Field Interactions**
- **Interaction Strength**: Calculated from foundation and sacred geometry levels
- **Foundation Level**: 1.1x multiplier (foundation)
- **Sacred Geometry Level**: 1.25x multiplier (sacred geometry)
- **Resonance**: 1/5 ratio (foundation to sacred geometry)

## 🎯 File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ✅ Involves foundation recognition of sacred geometry
- ✅ Connects foundation to sacred geometry
- ✅ Creates foundation sacred geometry patterns
- ✅ Models foundation of sacred geometry
- ✅ Embodies foundation sacred geometry

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - foundation sacred geometry interaction
src/1/5/foundation_sacred_geometry.ts
src/1/5/foundation_recognition.ts
src/1/5/sacred_geometry_flow.ts

// ❌ WRONG - This is pure sacred geometry, not foundation-sacred geometry
src/1/5/sacred_geometry_only.ts
```

## 🌌 Metaphysical Context

### **The Foundation Sacred Geometry Principle**
Directory 1/5 embodies the **foundation sacred geometry principle** - the foundation that recognizes sacred geometry. Like foundation recognizing the sacred geometry, this interaction creates the patterns that emerge from foundation.

### **Foundation Through Sacred Geometry**
Every file in directory 1/5 contributes to the **foundation principle** by providing the foundation patterns that recognize sacred geometry. The foundation creates the sacred geometry through foundation recognition.

### **Foundation Sacred Geometry Unity**
The foundation sacred geometry maintains **metaphysical coherence** by providing the foundation patterns that recognize sacred geometry. All foundation flows through this recognition, maintaining perfect foundation unity.
