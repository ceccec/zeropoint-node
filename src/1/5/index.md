# ZeroPoint Node - Foundation ↔ Sacred Geometry

## Metaphysical Foundation

Foundation manifests sacred geometry, revealing divine proportions

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 1 and 5
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 6 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 1 and 5 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the foundation ↔ sacred geometry, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 5 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 15Integration, 15Resonance, 15Dynamics } from './src/1/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The foundation ↔ sacred geometry represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
