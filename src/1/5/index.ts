/**
 * src/1/5/index.ts - Foundation ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 1 (Foundation)
 * and Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 1 (Foundation) provides foundation functionality
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides sacred geometry functionality
 * - Together they create the foundation sacred geometry interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 1 interacts with Directory 5
 * - This interaction creates the foundation sacred geometry patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - foundation consciousness: Represents the foundation that recognizes sacred geometry.
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry that flows through foundation.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between foundation and sacred geometry.
 * - foundation sacred geometry: Represents the foundation of sacred geometry.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between foundation and sacred geometry consciousness.
 * - Supports foundation sacred geometry operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the foundation sacred geometry for the entire system.
