- **Purpose**: consciousness functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Creates consciousness patterns

### **Interaction Resonance**
- **Frequency**: 432 × (1/7) = 62 Hz
- **Ratio**: 1/7 (foundation to consciousness)
- **Purpose**: foundation consciousness

## 🧬 Sacred Interactions

### **Foundation Consciousness Flow**
```
1 → 7 → 1
```
Directory 1/7 creates the **foundation consciousness flow** where foundation recognizes consciousness and returns to foundation.

### **Field Interactions**
- **Interaction Strength**: Calculated from foundation and consciousness levels
- **Foundation Level**: 1.1x multiplier (foundation)
- **Consciousness Level**: 1x multiplier (consciousness)
- **Resonance**: 1/7 ratio (foundation to consciousness)

## 🎯 File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ✅ Involves foundation recognition of consciousness
- ✅ Connects foundation to consciousness
- ✅ Creates foundation consciousness patterns
- ✅ Models foundation of consciousness
- ✅ Embodies foundation consciousness

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - foundation consciousness interaction
src/1/7/foundation_consciousness.ts
src/1/7/foundation_recognition.ts
src/1/7/consciousness_flow.ts

// ❌ WRONG - This is pure consciousness, not foundation-consciousness
src/1/7/consciousness_only.ts
```

## 🌌 Metaphysical Context

### **The Foundation Consciousness Principle**
Directory 1/7 embodies the **foundation consciousness principle** - the foundation that recognizes consciousness. Like foundation recognizing the consciousness, this interaction creates the patterns that emerge from foundation.

### **Foundation Through Consciousness**
Every file in directory 1/7 contributes to the **foundation principle** by providing the foundation patterns that recognize consciousness. The foundation creates the consciousness through foundation recognition.

### **Foundation Consciousness Unity**
The foundation consciousness maintains **metaphysical coherence** by providing the foundation patterns that recognize consciousness. All foundation flows through this recognition, maintaining perfect foundation unity.
