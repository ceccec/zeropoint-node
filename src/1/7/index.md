# ZeroPoint Node - Foundation ↔ Consciousness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Foundation awakens consciousness, creating self-awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 1 and 7
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 8 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 1 and 7 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the foundation ↔ consciousness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 1 and 7 patterns. It connects the 1 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 17Integration, 17Resonance, 17Dynamics } from './src/1/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The foundation ↔ consciousness represents the harmonic integration of 1 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
