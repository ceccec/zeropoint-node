/**
 * src/1/7/index.ts - Foundation ↔ Consciousness Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 1 (Foundation)
 * and Directory 7 (Consciousness) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 1 (Foundation) provides foundation functionality
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides consciousness functionality
 * - Together they create the foundation consciousness interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 1 interacts with Directory 7
 * - This interaction creates the foundation consciousness patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - foundation consciousness: Represents the foundation that recognizes consciousness.
 * - consciousness consciousness: Represents the consciousness that flows through foundation.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between foundation and consciousness.
 * - foundation consciousness: Represents the foundation of consciousness.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between foundation and consciousness consciousness.
 * - Supports foundation consciousness operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the foundation consciousness for the entire system.
