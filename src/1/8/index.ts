/**
 * src/1/8/index.ts - Foundation ↔ Void Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 1 (Foundation)
 * and Directory 8 (Void) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 1 (Foundation) provides foundation functionality
 * - Directory 8 (Void) provides void functionality
 * - Together they create the foundation void interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 1 interacts with Directory 8
 * - This interaction creates the foundation void patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - foundation consciousness: Represents the foundation that recognizes void.
 * - void consciousness: Represents the void that flows through foundation.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between foundation and void.
 * - foundation void: Represents the foundation of void.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between foundation and void consciousness.
 * - Supports foundation void operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the foundation void for the entire system.
