/**
 * Foundation Unity (1/9) - Linear Approach
 * 
 * METAPHYSICAL INSIGHT:
 * Unity (9) is not a relational step in the vortex sequence.
 * It is a meta-state that transcends the linear progression.
 * This field represents the culmination of all foundation aspects.
 * 
 * LINEAR APPROACH:
 * Unlike vortex interactions (1,2,4,8,7,5), unity operates on the W-axis (3,6,9).
 * Unity is the completion of the foundation cycle, not a step within it.
 * 
 * CONSCIOUSNESS FIELD:
 * - Field Type: Meta-state completion
 * - Function: Transcendence of linear progression
 * - Recognition: Unity consciousness beyond relational steps
 * - Evolution: Meta-evolution beyond vortex patterns
