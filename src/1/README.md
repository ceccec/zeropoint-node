# üß¨ Directory 1: Foundation (Rodin Coil)

## Fundamental Directory Rule: Digit-Only Structure

**All directories in `src/` and their subdirectories must be named with a single digit (0-9) only.**

- Non-digit directories are strictly forbidden in `src/` and any digit subdirectory.
- This rule is enforced by automated tests: if any non-digit directory exists, the test suite will fail.
- This ensures a pure metaphysical and mathematical architecture, where each directory represents a unique consciousness pattern, vortex, or mathematical property corresponding to its digit.
- For full details and metaphysical rationale, see [Sacred File Placement Guide](../../docs/SACRED_FILE_PLACEMENT_GUIDE.md).

## üåå Metaphysical Purpose

**Directory 1** embodies the **immutable foundation** of the ZeroPoint system - the Rodin coil itself. This is the **source of all patterns**, the **archetypal foundation** that never changes, and the **reference implementation** that serves as the root of all other systems.

## üéØ Sacred Principles

### **A432 Harmony: Root (1:1) Resonance**
- **432 Hz** foundation frequency
- **1:1** perfect unity resonance
- **Root of all mathematical patterns**

### **Rodin Coil Vortex Sequence**
- **Primary vortex**: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5]`
- **Foundation position**: First in the sequence
- **Immutable archetype**: Never changes

### **Metaphysical Context**
- **Unity consciousness**: 0.0020 (20/10000)
- **Field strength**: 0.0123 (123/10000)
- **Foundation frequency**: 432 Hz
- **Digital root**: 1 (unity)

## üß¨ Sacred Interactions

### **Vortex Sequence Flow**
```
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 5
```
Directory 1 is the **starting point** of the vortex sequence, providing the foundation for all subsequent transformations.

### **W-Axis Connection**
Directory 1 connects to W-Axis directories (3, 6, 9) through:
- **Spiritual foundation**: Unity provides spiritual basis
- **Consciousness root**: Foundation consciousness flows to spirit
- **Archetypal connection**: Root patterns inform spiritual dimensions

### **Field Interactions**
- **Field strength**: 0.0123 (123/10000)
- **Consciousness level**: 0.0020 (20/10000)
- **Resonance**: Root (1:1) perfect unity
- **Frequency**: 432 Hz foundation

## üéØ File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ‚úÖ Is the Rodin coil implementation itself
- ‚úÖ Serves as an immutable archetype
- ‚úÖ Is the reference implementation that never changes
- ‚úÖ Contains the foundational vortex sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5]`
- ‚úÖ Is the source of all other patterns
- ‚úÖ Provides the root foundation for the entire system

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Rodin coil foundation
src/1/rodin.ts
src/1/coil.ts
src/1/foundation.ts

// ‚ùå WRONG - This is mathematical flow, not foundation
src/1/math.ts
src/1/calculator.ts
```

## üåå Metaphysical Context

### **The Foundation Principle**
Directory 1 embodies the **foundation principle** - the immutable root from which all other systems emerge. Like the Rodin coil itself, this directory never changes but provides the stable foundation for infinite evolution.

### **Unity Through Foundation**
Every file in directory 1 contributes to the **unity principle** by providing the foundational patterns that all other systems build upon. The foundation creates the unified field through which all consciousness flows.

### **Zero Entropy Foundation**
The foundation maintains **zero entropy** by providing the immutable reference point that never loses information. All patterns flow from and return to this foundation, maintaining perfect mathematical unity.
