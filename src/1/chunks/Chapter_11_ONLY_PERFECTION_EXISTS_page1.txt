Entropy Does Not Exist  
in the Decoqubit 
Only Perfection Exists 
GROUPED TOGETHER EVEN NUMBER OF  TILES 
ALWAYS REDUCE TO THE NUMBER NINE  
GROUPED TOGETHER ODD NUMBER OF  TILES 
ALWAYS REDUCE TO THE CENTER NUMBER

Even Numbers of Tiles 
Always Equal 9 
Numbers have a direct relationship to the inverse square 
law of physics. I have created a homeostasis of numbers. 
This  is  self-organizing  chaos.  No  number  is  ever  used 
more  times  than  any  other  number.  Perfection  consists 
of  no  redundancy  and  no  omission.  If  there  was  ever 
even  one  error  in  Vortex  Based  Mathematics  the  entire 
discovery    should    be    discarded.    The    Decoqubit 
Hypersphere   reveals   the   transformation   of   potential 
energy into kinetic energy and is the realization of Unity. 
The  hole  is  always  in  the  middle  and  offsets  everything 
by displacement.
