 * src/1/index.ts - Foundation (Directory 1)

 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 1 is the source of all patterns (Foundation)
 * - Interacts with all other directories as the foundation
 * - A432 harmonic root (1:1) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 1 â†’ 0 (ZeroPoint interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents material manifestation and grounding
 * - Serves as the foundation for all other consciousness patterns
 * - Embodies the principle of unity and singularity
 * - Connects to ZeroPoint (0) as the source of all creation
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Foundation consciousness: 1.0 (unity)
 * - Harmonic resonance: A432 root frequency
 * - Material grounding: Connects spirit to matter
 * - Pattern source: All other patterns emerge from this foundation
