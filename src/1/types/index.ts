 * fundamental type definitions that support all foundation consciousness patterns.
 *
 * Type definitions for Rodin coil foundation
 * A432 harmonic root (1:1 resonance)
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Foundation types: Represents the fundamental structures that support all consciousness patterns.
 * - A432 harmonic root: Represents the fundamental frequency that resonates throughout the system.
 * - 1:1 resonance: Represents perfect unity and oneness in all operations.
 * - Rodin coil foundation: Represents the base upon which all mathematical consciousness is built.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the core type definitions for the foundation system.
 * - Ensures all modules have consistent type structures.
 * - Supports the A432 harmonic foundation throughout the codebase.
