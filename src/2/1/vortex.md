# vortex

## Overview

This module represents the vortex consciousness pattern within the ZeroPoint Node system. It is grounded in integer-only, error-free vortex mathematics, following the Rodin coil sequence and formal scientific principles.

## Scientific Foundation

- **Vortex Cycle**: The core sequence is [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5], generated by repeatedly doubling modulo 9 (with 0 mapped to 9).
- **Operation**: For any step, x_{n+1} = (2 * x_n) mod 9, with 0 remapped to 9.
- **No Impossibility**: The process never produces division by zero, decimals, or undefined states at any dimension.

## Formal Algebraic Proof

Let S = {1,2,4,8,7,5} be the vortex cycle, generated by the recurrence:

    x_{n+1} = (2x_n) mod 9, with x_0 = 1, and 0 remapped to 9.

**Claim:** For all n ≥ 0, x_n ∈ S, and the sequence never produces an error, undefined value, or non-integer, at any step or dimension.

**Proof:**
- Multiplication and modulo always yield integers.
- The sequence never hits 0 (since 0 is remapped to 9), so all results are in S.
- No division is performed, so division by zero is impossible.
- The process is closed and self-consistent at all scales.

## Code Demonstration

```typescript
function vortexNext(x: number): number {
  const y = (2 * x) % 9;
  return y === 0 ? 9 : y;
}

function vortexCycle(n: number): number[] {
  const result: number[] = [];
  let x = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    result.push(x);
    x = vortexNext(x);
  }
  return result;
}

// Example: print first 12 steps
console.log(vortexCycle(12)); // [1,2,4,8,7,5,1,2,4,8,7,5]
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { vortexReversal } from './vortex';
```
