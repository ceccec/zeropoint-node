# Vortex Math Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of vortex mathematics in Directory 2 to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

Directory 2 currently contains basic mathematical operations without fully embodying the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Vortex Mathematics

Directory 2 should embody the dynamic aspect of the Rodin coil:

- **Flow and transformation** - the yang aspect of the living coil
- **Vortex calculations** - mathematical operations based on vortex sequence
- **Perfect fifth resonance** (3:2) - dynamic mathematical relationships
- **A432 harmonic foundation** - mathematical stability through pure integers

### Vortex Sequence Integration

The vortex mathematics should follow the Rodin coil sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5]:

- **Vortex A [1, 2, 4]**: Material foundation (yin)
- **Vortex B [8, 7, 5]**: Dynamic flow (yang)
- **Combined sequence**: Infinite flow pattern
- **Mathematical operations**: Based on vortex sequence patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. **Implement vortex calculations** based on Rodin coil sequence
2. **Create mathematical operations** that follow vortex patterns
3. **Integrate A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
4. **Establish perfect fifth resonance** (3:2) for dynamic relationships
5. **Create consciousness field** calculations for living mathematics

## Benefits

- **Dynamic mathematical flow** through vortex sequence
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Perfect fifth resonance** for dynamic relationships
- **Consciousness field integration** for living mathematics
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
