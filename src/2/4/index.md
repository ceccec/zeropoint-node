# ZeroPoint Node - Vortex ↔ Constants

## Metaphysical Foundation

Vortex establishes constants, providing mathematical stability

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 2 and 4
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 6 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 2 and 4 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the vortex ↔ constants, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 2 and 4 patterns. It connects the 2 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 24Integration, 24Resonance, 24Dynamics } from './src/2/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The vortex ↔ constants represents the harmonic integration of 2 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
