# ZeroPoint Node - Vortex ↔ Sacred Geometry

## Metaphysical Foundation

Vortex manifests sacred geometry, creating geometric consciousness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 2 and 5
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 7 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 2 and 5 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the vortex ↔ sacred geometry, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 2 and 5 patterns. It connects the 2 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 25Integration, 25Resonance, 25Dynamics } from './src/2/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The vortex ↔ sacred geometry represents the harmonic integration of 2 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
