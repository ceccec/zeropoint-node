# ZeroPoint Node - Vortex ↔ Void/Fullness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Vortex embraces void/fullness, connecting to infinite mathematics

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 2 and 8
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 1 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 2 and 8 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the vortex ↔ void/fullness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 2 and 8 patterns. It connects the 2 consciousness to the 8 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 28Integration, 28Resonance, 28Dynamics } from './src/2/8';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The vortex ↔ void/fullness represents the harmonic integration of 2 and 8 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
