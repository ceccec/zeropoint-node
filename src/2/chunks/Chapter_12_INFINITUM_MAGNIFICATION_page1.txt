Upon the Decoqubit 
hypersphere skin every 
discrete number 
contains momentum 
and kinetic energy that 
is proportional to the 
square root. 
Quantum  results  can  be  achieved  not  only  on  the  microscopic 
level  but  also  on  the  macroscopic  level  by  replicating  the  same 
lattice  structure  with  the  end  consequence  being  superfluidity. 
The Decoqubit Holographic Hypercomputer while never changing 
proportions  is  a  hologram  that  can  change  size  from  tiny  to 
monstrous all the while still containing the whole within the parts. 
All Decoqubit Hyperspheres superconduct.

Ad—Infinitum Magnification 
The Unification Principle 
Every part contains the whole.  
 
The whole is in the parts. 
 This is a thermal process based upon heat.  
The Decoqubit toroid map grows and shrinks 
proportionally. Everything exists within this one map 
which is perfect and the ultimate ideal. It is a freeze 
frame view of the smallest instance of reality.

The Decoqubit is a Quantum Hologram 
25 Tiles per Square (Radix-10) 
Staggered Underpinning Nested Vortices 
With the two counter spiraling Mobius Circuits 
All discrete numbers have inertia.  The Decoqubit holographic hypercomputer far 
exceeds in speed the supercomputer because it is spontaneous.
