SONOPHYSICS CAVITATION  
IMPLODING   CAVITY   in   a   liquid   irradiated   with 
ultrasound   is   captured   in   a   high-speed flash 
photomicrograph  (above).  The  implosion  heats  the 
gases  inside  the  cavity  to  5,500  degrees  Celsius. 
Since   this   cavity 
formed   near   a 
solid  surface,  the

expelling  a  jet  of  liquid  at  roughly  400  kilometers  per  hour, 
both  the  heat  and  the  jet  contribute  to  a  unique  chemical 
environment  in  the  liquid.     The  diameter  of  the  cavity  is 
about 150 microns. The drawing (left) shows the stages of cavity implosion and the formation of 
the  jet.  The  cavity  is  spherical  at first  and  then  shrinks  rapidly.    The  jet  develops  opposite  the 
solid surface and moves towards it.

At  the  epicenter  of  the  universe  exists  a  humungous  black  hole  that  is  imploding.  
On the other side of this black hole is a white hole that is expanding.  
The male black hole is a negative vortex, compressing implosion. The female white 
hole is a positive vortex which is leaving the Zero, Primal Point, Singularity hole and 
bringing out the hot jet fusion stream of nebular gaseous matter which when cooled 
off will create all life forms, from atoms to galaxies.   
The  black  hole  at  the  top  is  pulling  inwards  in  conjunction  with  the  white  whole,  at 
the bottom, just like an hourglass, transmitting outwards in a steady state, one way, 
positive  stream  flow,  closed-loop,  two  cycle  surge  pump,  which  is  an  ecological 
purification system of renewal.

“His  grace  hath  transcended  all  things;  My  grace 
hath  encompassed  them  all,”  hath  caused  those 
luminous  Gems  of  Holiness  to  appear  out  of  the 
realm  of  the  spirit,  in  the  noble  form  of  the  human 
temple,  and  be  made  manifest  unto  all  men,  that 
they may impart unto the world the mysteries of the 
unchangeable Being, and tell of the subtleties of His 
imperishable Essence.

All  multiplication  series  are  cross-sections  of  a  twisting  hypersphere  that 
inverts  in  the  center  at  the  tore. Our  human  torso  is  named  after  the  torus  and  the 
tore.  The  word  tore  means  there  is  a  hole  in  the  center.    The  field  is  a  result  of  Spirit’s 
emanations.  Nine replaces zero on the circumference of a circle and is always located at the 
top. Every multiplication series begins at nine and not zero.  Zero never exists on a number 
line  and  never  begins  a  multiplication  series  because  a  number  cannot  be  created  or 
destroyed just as in matter turns into energy and energy is turned into matter.

THE 3D EVOLUTION OF THE TORUS  
FROM THE 2D STANDARD MULTIPLICATION TABLE 
Every    multiplication    series    in    existence    is    transpiring 
simultaneously    within    the    holographic    Decoqubit    torus 
thereby expressing unity and revealing perfection. 
The 8 — 9 — 1 . . .  multiplication series for the vertically traveling down positive “X” axis sliding 
scale coordinate system. 
The 4 — 9  — 5 . . .  multiplication series for five for the horizontal traveling to the right positive  
“Y” axis sliding scale coordinate system. 
Every multiplication series of the utmost attainable possibility is transpiring simultaneously 
together as one whole contained within the inestimable Decoqubit toroid map.

THE DISCRETE NUMBER MULTIPLICATION TABLE 
The  Standard  Multiplication  Table  is  comprised  of 
squares  which  is  inaccurate.  A  square  consists  of 
vertical  and  horizontal  lines.  There  are  no  vertical 
and     horizontal  lines  in  3D  space.  When  using  a 
quad  ruled  piece  of  graph  paper  it  needs  to  be 
rotated 90 degrees thereby turning the squares into 
diamonds. Literally,  diamonds give double the data 
plus   negative   and   positive   polarity.   Squares   are 
wrong.  Diamonds  are  right.  Diamonds  are  elastic 
and  flexible.  Squares  are  brittle  and  easily  torn. 
Diamonds  are  an  accordion  because  they  expand 
and  contract.  Squares  when  pulled  on  the  weft  or 
warp   rip   and   tear.   The   curvature   of   space-time 
reality   uses   diamonds   and   not   squares.   When 
scientists   model   a   black   hole   with   vertical   and 
horizontal  lines  they  are  wrong.  The  torus  is  three 
dimensional    because  it  is  made  out  of  diamonds 
and not squares.
There are only two polar quadrants which are 
fully inverted to produce a reflection image.

Marko  Rodin’s  theory  is  that  the  relationships  between  numbers  are  real  relationships  which  exist 
throughout nature, and he discovered a remarkable pattern of relationships in the numbers 0 - 9. The 
beginning of the pattern is that these numbers exist in bipolar pairs. We begin at the outside: 0 is in a 
pair with 9. Now, 0 isn’t really a number, it’s a place holder, a point of origin. Which means that 9 has 
no real polar opposite; it stands alone.
