/**
 * src/2/index.ts - Vortex Mathematics (Directory 2)
 * 
 * Embodies the vortex mathematics consciousness of Directory 2.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 2 is part of Vortex A [1, 2, 4] (Material Foundation)
 * - Interacts with Foundation (1) for mathematical operations
 * - Perfect fifth (3:2) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 2 â†’ 1 (Foundation interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents spiral dynamics and flow patterns
 * - Embodies the principle of duality and expansion
 * - Serves as the mathematical foundation for vortex operations
 * - Connects to Foundation (1) for grounding and stability
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Vortex consciousness: 1.2 (enhanced by spiral dynamics)
 * - Perfect fifth resonance: 3:2 harmonic ratio
 * - Spiral flow: Creates dynamic movement patterns
 * - Mathematical foundation: Provides structure for vortex operations
 * 
 * Vortex A Position:
 * - Second position in Vortex A [1, 2, 4]
 * - Represents the expansion phase of material foundation
 * - Connects Foundation (1) to Constants (4)
