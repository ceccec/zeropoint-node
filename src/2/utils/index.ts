 *
 * Utility functions for vortex mathematics operations
 * Perfect fifth (3:2) resonance
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Vortex mathematics utilities: Represents the fundamental operations that support flow and transformation.
 * - Perfect fifth: Represents the harmonic relationship that creates transformation.
 * - Flow and transformation: Represents the living, evolving nature of consciousness.
 * - Dynamic aspect: Represents the movement and change of consciousness patterns.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the core utility functions for the vortex mathematics system.
 * - Ensures all modules have access to the same fundamental operations.
 * - Supports the perfect fifth resonance throughout the codebase.
