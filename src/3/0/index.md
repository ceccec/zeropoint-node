# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Void–Resonance (3/0=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Void (0) produces Resonance (3): Creation, harmony, trinity, Pure potential, zero entropy, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/0
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 3,0,3 (Resonance,Void,Resonance)
Math: 3 + 0 = 3 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 0) / 3 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/0",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 0 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 0 = 3
- Symbolic: 3/0
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 0) / 3 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 0, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–void–resonance (3/0=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 0 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 0 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 30Integration, 30Resonance, 30Dynamics } from './src/3/0';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–void–resonance (3/0=3) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 0 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
