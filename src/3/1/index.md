# ZeroPoint Node - Creative Resonance ↔ Foundation

## Metaphysical Foundation

Creative resonance flows from foundation, manifesting artistic expression

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 3 and 1
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 4 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 3 and 1 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the creative resonance ↔ foundation, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 1 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 1 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 31Integration, 31Resonance, 31Dynamics } from './src/3/1';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The creative resonance ↔ foundation represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 1 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
