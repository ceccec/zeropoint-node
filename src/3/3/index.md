# ZeroPoint Node - Creative Resonance Core

## Metaphysical Foundation

Creative resonance core - the artistic and innovative expression of consciousness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Core Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 3 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 6 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 3 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Core Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the creative resonance core, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 3 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 33Integration, 33Resonance, 33Dynamics } from './src/3/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The creative resonance core represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
