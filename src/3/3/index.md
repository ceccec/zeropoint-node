# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Resonance–Harmony (3/3=6)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Resonance (3) produces Harmony (6): Creation, harmony, trinity, Creation, harmony, trinity, Balance, beauty, equilibrium.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/3
Harmonic: 6
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 3,3,6 (Resonance,Resonance,Harmony)
Math: 3 + 3 = 6 ≡ 6 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 3) / 6 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/3",
  "harmonicResult": 6,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 3 → 6",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 3 = 6
- Symbolic: 3/3
- Harmonic: 6
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 3) / 6 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 3, 6
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–resonance–harmony (3/3=6), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 3 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 33Integration, 33Resonance, 33Dynamics } from './src/3/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–resonance–harmony (3/3=6) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
