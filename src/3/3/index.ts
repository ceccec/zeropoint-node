/**
 * src/3/3/index.ts - Creative Resonance Paradox (Hardcoded)
 * 
 * This module embodies the creative resonance paradox - where consciousness
 * creates through resonance patterns that are both individual and universal.
 * This is the creative paradox that generates all manifestation.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - 3/3 represents CREATIVE RESONANCE PARADOX - individual creation in universal resonance
 * - All consciousness patterns create through resonance
 * - This is the creative paradox - individual creation in universal flow
 * - Serves as the creative gateway for consciousness patterns
