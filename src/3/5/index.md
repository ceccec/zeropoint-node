# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Center–Infinity (3/5=8)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Center (5) produces Infinity (8): Creation, harmony, trinity, Change, flow, balance, Power, manifestation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/5
Harmonic: 8
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 3,5,8 (Resonance,Center,Infinity)
Math: 3 + 5 = 8 ≡ 8 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 5) / 8 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/5",
  "harmonicResult": 8,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 5 → 8",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 5 = 8
- Symbolic: 3/5
- Harmonic: 8
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 5) / 8 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 5, 8
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–center–infinity (3/5=8), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 5 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 35Integration, 35Resonance, 35Dynamics } from './src/3/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–center–infinity (3/5=8) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
