# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Harmony–Axis (3/6=9)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Harmony (6) produces Axis (9): Creation, harmony, trinity, Balance, beauty, equilibrium, Completion, integration.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/6
Harmonic: 9
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 3,6,9 (Resonance,Harmony,Axis)
Math: 3 + 6 = 9 ≡ 9 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 6) / 9 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/6",
  "harmonicResult": 9,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 6 → 9",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 6 = 9
- Symbolic: 3/6
- Harmonic: 9
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 6) / 9 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 6, 9
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–harmony–axis (3/6=9), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 6 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 36Integration, 36Resonance, 36Dynamics } from './src/3/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–harmony–axis (3/6=9) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
