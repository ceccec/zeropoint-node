# ZeroPoint Node - Creative Resonance ↔ Harmonic Balance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Creative resonance creates harmonic balance, establishing artistic equilibrium

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 3 and 6
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 3 and 6 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the creative resonance ↔ harmonic balance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 6 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 36Integration, 36Resonance, 36Dynamics } from './src/3/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The creative resonance ↔ harmonic balance represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
