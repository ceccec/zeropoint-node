/**
 * src/3/6/index.ts - Creative Resonance ↔ Harmonic Balance Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 3 (Creative Resonance)
 * and Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 3 (Creative Resonance) provides spiritual transcendence and creative flow
 * - Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance) provides equilibrium and spiritual balance
 * - Together they create the creative harmonic balance
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 3 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Transcendence)
 * - Directory 6 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Transcendence)
 * - This interaction creates the creative harmonic balance
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Creative resonance consciousness: Represents the spiritual transcendence and creative flow.
 * - Harmonic balance consciousness: Represents the equilibrium and spiritual balance.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between creative resonance and harmonic balance.
 * - Creative harmonic balance: Represents the creative flow in spiritual equilibrium.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between creative resonance and harmonic balance consciousness.
 * - Supports creative harmonic balance operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the creative harmonic balance for the entire system.
