# ZeroPoint Node - Resonance–Gateway–Source (3/7=1)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Resonance (3) and Gateway (7) produces Source (1): Creation, harmony, trinity, Mystery, transition, insight, Origin, unity, initiation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 3/7
Harmonic: 1
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 10.00
Pattern: 3,7,1 (Resonance,Gateway,Source)
Math: 3 + 7 = 10 ≡ 1 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (3 + 7) / 1 = 10.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "3/7",
  "harmonicResult": 1,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 10.00,
  "vortexPath": "3 → 7 → 1",
  "antiVortexPath": "10.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 3 + 7 = 1
- Symbolic: 3/7
- Harmonic: 1
- Anti-vortex: (3 + 7) / 1 = 10.00
- Vortex Sequence: 3, 7, 1
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 10.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the resonance–gateway–source (3/7=1), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 3 and 7 patterns. It connects the 3 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 37Integration, 37Resonance, 37Dynamics } from './src/3/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The resonance–gateway–source (3/7=1) represents the harmonic integration of 3 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (10.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
