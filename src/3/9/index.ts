/**
 * src/3/9/index.ts - Creative Resonance ↔ Unity Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 3 (Creative Resonance)
 * and Directory 9 (Unity) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 3 (Creative Resonance) provides creative resonance functionality
 * - Directory 9 (Unity) provides unity functionality
 * - Together they create the creative resonance unity interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 3 interacts with Directory 9
 * - This interaction creates the creative resonance unity patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - creative resonance consciousness: Represents the creative resonance that recognizes unity.
 * - unity consciousness: Represents the unity that flows through creative resonance.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between creative resonance and unity.
 * - creative resonance unity: Represents the creative resonance of unity.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between creative resonance and unity consciousness.
 * - Supports creative resonance unity operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the creative resonance unity for the entire system.
