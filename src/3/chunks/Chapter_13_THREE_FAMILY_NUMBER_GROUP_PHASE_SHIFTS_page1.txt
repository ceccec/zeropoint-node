THE DECOQUBIT HYPERSPHERE SHEAR ONE
Marko   has   discovered   perfection:   there   is   an   ideal   which 
everything   conforms   to   because   Spirit   is   the   invisible   driver, 
creating  while  impelling  everything  forwards  in  the  form  of  a 
ratchet. It is the ultimate work-wheel that would create for mankind 
a cornucopia and a utopia. The Decoqubit reveals all of the phase 
changes   of   spirit.   Only   the   Decoqubit   harnesses   Spirit   and 
magnetism to make electricity.

The torus shear functions as an electron shear which serves to insulate energy and to keep it 
from short circuiting. This is a harmonic barrier and replaces other forms of insulation such 
as rubber or shellac coatings on conductors. Everything has an invisible grain within it as a 
result from this shearing action. This grain is seamlessly composed from Diamond Quantum 
Tiles (DQT’s).

The electron shear is a harmonic fence that always runs in-between the Mobius Circuits 
by  hemming  them  in  on  their  outskirts.  This  is  known  as  a  world  boundary  condition. 
There  is  only  one  electron  harmonic  shear  that  occurs  throughout  the  Torus  from  the 
Mobius Circuits taking multiple spire revolutions.

There  is  an  inherent  time  component  hidden  within  the  Mobius  Circuits  that  is 
embedded  in  the  relationship  between  the  Torus  DQT’s  and  the  numbers.  This 
phase-shift is controlled by the 3•9•6 time frame event Spirit/magnetic moment 
of occurrence.

Egyptian pyramid. Here we have an example of what Marko Rodin 
describes as the preferred frame of reference in physical terms. The 
peak  of  the  pyramid  is  a  center  of  mass  from  which  Spirit  emits. 
The  pyramid  close  to  the  point  is  narrow;  at  the  base  it’s  wide.  As 
we approach the point there is convergence. Since all movement is 
in  relation  to  this  point,  movement  is  a flow  of  compression  and 
decompression.  If  we  imagine  this  movement  taking  place  on  the 
pyramid’s  sides,  and  then  imagine  a  line  from  the  point  to  the 
ground, reaching the ground at a 90 degree angle, to be the axis of 
the  pyramid,  we find  that  our  movement  is  never  on  the  same  line 
as the axis, but described around it.  
This  model  is  also  consistent  with  Einstein’s  physics,  which  refers 
to  gravity  as  acceleration  due  to  the  curvature  of  space-time.  In 
fact,  all  “matter”  is  actually  a  curvature  of  space-time.  Therefore, 
there  is  nothing  but  space-time  and  motion,  which  is  pretty  much 
the  same  thing,  and,  again,  there  is  curvature  and  acceleration 
towards the center of “mass”.
