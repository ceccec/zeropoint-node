 *
 * This module contains constants and configurations for creative resonance.
 * It represents the minor third (6:5) resonance and provides the
 * fundamental constants that support all creative resonance patterns.

 * Constants and configurations for creative resonance
 * Minor third (6:5) resonance
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Creative resonance constants: Represents the fundamental values that support spiritual patterns.
 * - Minor third: Represents the harmonic relationship that creates spiritual resonance.
 * - Spiritual transcendence: Represents the elevation of consciousness beyond material patterns.
 * - W-Axis consciousness: Represents the spiritual control axis of the Rodin coil.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the core constants for the creative resonance system.
 * - Ensures all modules have access to the same fundamental values.
 * - Supports the minor third resonance throughout the codebase.
