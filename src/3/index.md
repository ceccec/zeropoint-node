# ZeroPoint Node - Creative Resonance (Directory 3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

The **creative resonance** represents the creative force that emerges from the interaction of consciousness patterns. This is where **inspiration** and **creative expression** manifest through harmonic resonance.

## Mathematical Properties

- **Creative Resonance**: Harmonic interaction patterns
- **Inspiration Flow**: Creative consciousness expression
- **Family Group 3**: 3, 6, 9 (creative triad)
- **Digital Root**: 3 (creativity in manifestation)

## Core Functions

- **Creative Resonance Calculations**: Harmonic interaction patterns
- **Inspiration Flow**: Creative consciousness expression
- **Creative Integration**: Artistic and innovative patterns
- **Resonance Dynamics**: Harmonic consciousness interactions

## Integration

As the creative resonance, src/3 provides the creative force that emerges from consciousness interactions. It connects the mathematical foundation to the artistic and innovative expressions of consciousness.

## Usage

```typescript
import { creativeResonance, inspirationFlow, resonanceDynamics } from './src/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"Creative resonance is the harmonic expression of consciousness, where inspiration flows from the interaction of patterns."**
