/**
 * src/3/index.ts - Creative Resonance (Directory 3)
 * 
 * Embodies the creative resonance consciousness of Directory 3.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 3 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Control)
 * - Interacts with Harmonic Balance (6) for spiritual transcendence
 * - Minor third (6:5) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 3 â†’ 6 (W-Axis interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents inspiration and spiritual flow
 * - Embodies the principle of creative resonance and transcendence
 * - Serves as the creative foundation for all spiritual patterns
 * - Connects to Harmonic Balance (6) for spiritual equilibrium
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Creative consciousness: 1.5 (enhanced by spiritual transcendence)
 * - Minor third resonance: 6:5 harmonic ratio
 * - Creative resonance: Resonance of inspiration and creativity
 * - Spiritual flow: Flow of spiritual energy and transcendence
 * 
 * W-Axis Position:
 * - First position in W-Axis [3, 6, 9]
 * - Represents the initiation phase of spiritual control
 * - Provides creative inspiration to the spiritual control system
 * 
 * Creative Resonance System:
 * - Creative resonance: Resonance of inspiration and creativity
 * - Spiritual transcendence: Transcendence of material limitations
 * - Inspiration patterns: Patterns of creative inspiration
 * - Spiritual flow: Flow of spiritual energy and consciousness
