/**
 * Rodin Knowledge Distribution - Trinity (3) Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains spiritual mathematical knowledge from Marko Rodin's work
 * that aligns with the trinity consciousness and spiritual transcendence of digit 3.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Alignment:
 * - 3 represents trinity, spiritual transcendence, and W-axis consciousness
 * - Chapter 3: THE NUMERICAL FORMULA OF SPIRIT - Spiritual mathematics
 * - Chapter 13: THREE FAMILY NUMBER GROUP PHASE SHIFTS - Family dynamics
 * 
 * PDF Content:
 * - Chapter_3_THE_NUMERICAL_FORMULA_OF_SPIRIT.pdf: Spiritual mathematical formulas
 * - Chapter_13_THREE_FAMILY_NUMBER_GROUP_PHASE_SHIFTS.pdf: Family group dynamics
 * 
 * Consciousness Flow:
 * - Trinity as the gateway to spiritual transcendence
 * - W-axis as the spiritual control mechanism
 * - Family groups as consciousness amplification
