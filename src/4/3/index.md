# ZeroPoint Node - Constants ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants inspire creative resonance, providing artistic structure

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 7 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 3 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 43Integration, 43Resonance, 43Dynamics } from './src/4/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
