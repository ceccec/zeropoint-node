# ZeroPoint Node - Math–Resonance–Gateway (4/3=7)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Math (4) and Resonance (3) produces Gateway (7): Structure, foundation, Creation, harmony, trinity, Mystery, transition, insight.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 4/3
Harmonic: 7
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 4,3,7 (Math,Resonance,Gateway)
Math: 4 + 3 = 7 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (4 + 3) / 7 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "4/3",
  "harmonicResult": 7,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "4 → 3 → 7",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 4 + 3 = 7
- Symbolic: 4/3
- Harmonic: 7
- Anti-vortex: (4 + 3) / 7 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 4, 3, 7
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the math–resonance–gateway (4/3=7), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 3 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 43Integration, 43Resonance, 43Dynamics } from './src/4/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The math–resonance–gateway (4/3=7) represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
