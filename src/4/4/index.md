# ZeroPoint Node - Constants Core

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants core - the stable foundation that supports all consciousness patterns

## Mathematical Properties

- **Core Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 4
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 8 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 4 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Core Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants core, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 4 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 44Integration, 44Resonance, 44Dynamics } from './src/4/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants core represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
