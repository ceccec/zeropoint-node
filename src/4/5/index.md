# ZeroPoint Node - Constants ↔ Sacred Geometry

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants manifest sacred geometry, providing geometric stability

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 5
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 5 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants ↔ sacred geometry, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 5 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 45Integration, 45Resonance, 45Dynamics } from './src/4/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants ↔ sacred geometry represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
