# ZeroPoint Node - Constants ↔ Harmonic Balance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants create harmonic balance, establishing structural equilibrium

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 6
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 1 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 6 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants ↔ harmonic balance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 6 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 46Integration, 46Resonance, 46Dynamics } from './src/4/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants ↔ harmonic balance represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
