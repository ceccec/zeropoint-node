# ZeroPoint Node - Constants ↔ Consciousness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants awaken consciousness, providing conscious stability

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 7
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 2 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 7 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants ↔ consciousness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 7 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 47Integration, 47Resonance, 47Dynamics } from './src/4/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants ↔ consciousness represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
