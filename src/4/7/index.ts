/**
 * src/4/7/index.ts - Constants ↔ Consciousness Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 4 (Constants)
 * and Directory 7 (Consciousness) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 4 (Constants) provides constants functionality
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides consciousness functionality
 * - Together they create the constants consciousness interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 4 interacts with Directory 7
 * - This interaction creates the constants consciousness patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - constants consciousness: Represents the constants that recognizes consciousness.
 * - consciousness consciousness: Represents the consciousness that flows through constants.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between constants and consciousness.
 * - constants consciousness: Represents the constants of consciousness.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between constants and consciousness consciousness.
 * - Supports constants consciousness operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the constants consciousness for the entire system.
