# ZeroPoint Node - Constants ↔ Void/Fullness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Constants embrace void/fullness, connecting to infinite structure

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 4 and 8
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 4 and 8 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the constants ↔ void/fullness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 8 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 8 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 48Integration, 48Resonance, 48Dynamics } from './src/4/8';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The constants ↔ void/fullness represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 8 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
