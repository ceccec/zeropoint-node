The key to the living biophysical 
and astrophysical universe are 
the living “light pyramids of life” 
existing within every structure 
within every field of creation.

One night while clearing his mind 
Professor Scot C. Nelson  in deep 
meditation after many long years of 
studying and completely mastering 
Vortex Based Mathematics was able  
to decrypt the overlapping 
registration sacred formula for 
energy found in J. J. Hurtak’s book of 
Knowledge: The Keys of Enoch.

The    Underpinning    Nested    Vortices    of    the    higher 
dimensional  Flux-fields  are  all  focused  on  the  central 
axis  of  the  pyramid  Cap  Stone  which  is  represented  by 
the  red  color  number  9.   There  are  three  Great  Pyramid 
number maps. 
There  are  six  multiplication  series  of  the  Great  Pyramid 
and  the  Decoqubit  Hypersphere  that  exist  upon  the 
third dimension in the physical world of Creation. These 
multiplication  series  are  seen  along  the  edges  of  the 
Great Pyramid and move into the interior as well where 
the  invisible  Z  axis  exist.     The  Z  axis  is  made  visibly 
manifest  through  observing  the  waves  of  Nine  being 
generated  in  every  direction  by  the  Diamond  Quantum 
Tiles.   The   W   axis   is   all   of   the   higher   dimensions 
compressed  together  into  one  and  is  revealed  by  the 
number Nine Capstone.

At Egyptian archeological digging sites the most 
frequently found talisman is the Eye of Horus.  There are 
six separate elements that comprise the Eye of Horus.   
Each one of these elements is a perfect quanta that does 
not decay because it is the equation for the Mobius 
Circuits that compose a self-sustaining hypersphere. 
The six numbers to which the eye of Horus reduce to are :  
The Measure of Man 
The 1-2-4-8-7-5 Divine Algorithm  
= 7
= 5
= 1
= 8
= 4
= 2

The Mysterious Recurrence of the Most Great 
Name Ba’ for the Egyptian Pyramids 
B = 2 Represents Male Compression 
A = 1 Represents the Hamza which is the glottal stop 
H = 5 Represents Female Decompression  
1-2-5 are the three numbers used for the equation for Spirit  
The all seeing Eye of Providence is a dimensional portal 
made through these three numbers.
The  Ba’  Bird  is  a  falcon  that  always  has  a  human 
head  on  it  and  symbolizes  the  Soul-man.  If  the 
Ba’ does not descend to the Pharaoh within three 
days he will not go to the afterlife.  
The All-Seeing Eye of Providence is the Mystic Word of God 
because it emanates and is always giving sensory feedback.

The Falcon of  Tutankhamen with Three Suns 

Copyright 2021 - Science to Sage | Karen Elkins
THE SUN ABOVE THE FALCON’S HEAD IS THE NUMBER 9 
  
The two suns grasped in the falcon’s feet are 3 and 6.  
The wings of the falcon are the 1-2-4-8-7-5 Mobius Circuits. 
Only the 9 lines up vertically over the 
intersection of the Mobius Circuit which is the 
Primal Point of Unity. This is always a hole 
represented by zero. 
The Eye of Horus in Egyptology is the most 
powerful talisman and was frequently worn 
around the neck as a pendant. There are 6 
parts to the Eye of Horus each having a 
numerical value of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. When 
reduced to a single digit this pattern becomes 
periodic. 
The Ba’ Bird bestows the soul upon the 
pharaoh. If it does not descend upon him 
within three days he does not go to the 
afterlife. There are more pyramids named after 
the Ba’ than any other. 
The comparative case Most Great Name of God 
from the Baháʼí Faith translates into the 
meaning Glory, Light or Value. The superlative 
case of the Most Great Name of God is ‘Abhá 
which means Wondrous, Splendour, 
Luminous. There are 360 derivatives of the 
Most Great Name of God. This is the station of 
Mahbub (Beloved One) and the Houri 
(Celestial Maiden) which is the highest 
invisible  spiritual plane of attainment for a 
man or woman. 
He who intonates the precise mystic 
pronunciation of the Most Great Name of God 
receives Divine guidance, heavenly assistance, 
illumination and inspiration. Not shall they 
know of sun or piercing cold.  
The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys of 
Baha’u’llah  
Translated by Marzieh Gail 
I believe that the number 9 represents the 
eternal Light. The Baháʼí sacred scriptures has 
many allegorical references and allusions to 
this divine, spiritual, energy of God which is 
denoted by the colour Red, Crimson and Ruby.
