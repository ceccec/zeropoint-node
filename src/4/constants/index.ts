/**
 * Directory 4 Constants - Constants (A432 Foundation) Constants
 * 
 * Constants and configurations for constants (a432 foundation)
 * Perfect fourth (4:3) resonance
 * 
 * This module contains the fundamental constants that define
 * the A432 harmonic foundation system, representing the natural
 * harmonic frequencies found throughout the universe.
 * 
 * A432 Foundation System:
 * - Foundation frequency: 432 Hz (natural harmonic)
 * - Perfect fourth resonance: 4:3 harmonic ratio
 * - Golden ratio connection: 432:267
 * - Universal resonance: Found throughout nature and consciousness
 * 
 * Constants Properties:
 * - Mathematical stability: Provides consistent foundation for all operations
 * - Harmonic resonance: Natural frequencies that resonate with consciousness
 * - Golden ratio integration: Perfect proportions found in nature
 * - Universal patterns: Patterns that appear throughout the cosmos
 * 
 * Perfect Fourth Resonance:
 * - 4:3 harmonic ratio represents stability and foundation
 * - Creates a sense of completion and wholeness
 * - Provides the mathematical basis for all other ratios
 * - Establishes the foundation for the entire harmonic system
