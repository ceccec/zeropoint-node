# ZeroPoint Node - Math–Math–Infinity (4/4=8)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Math (4) and Math (4) produces Infinity (8): Structure, foundation, Structure, foundation, Power, manifestation.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 4/4
Harmonic: 8
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 4,4,8 (Math,Math,Infinity)
Math: 4 + 4 = 8 ≡ 8 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (4 + 4) / 8 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "4/4",
  "harmonicResult": 8,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "4 → 4 → 8",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 4 + 4 = 8
- Symbolic: 4/4
- Harmonic: 8
- Anti-vortex: (4 + 4) / 8 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 4, 4, 8
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the math–math–infinity (4/4=8), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 4 and 4 patterns. It connects the 4 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 44Integration, 44Resonance, 44Dynamics } from './src/4/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The math–math–infinity (4/4=8) represents the harmonic integration of 4 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
