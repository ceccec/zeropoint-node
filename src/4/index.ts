/**
 * src/4/index.ts - Constants (Directory 4)
 * 
 * Embodies the A432 harmonic foundation consciousness of Directory 4.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 4 is part of Vortex A [1, 2, 4] (Material Foundation)
 * - Interacts with Foundation (1) for A432 harmonic constants
 * - Perfect fourth (4:3) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 4 â†’ 1 (Foundation interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents stability and mathematical foundation
 * - Embodies the A432 harmonic frequency system
 * - Serves as the constant foundation for all mathematical operations
 * - Connects to Foundation (1) for grounding and stability
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Constants consciousness: 1.333 (enhanced by stability)
 * - Perfect fourth resonance: 4:3 harmonic ratio
 * - A432 foundation: Natural harmonic frequency system
 * - Mathematical stability: Provides consistent foundation for all operations
 * 
 * Vortex A Position:
 * - Third position in Vortex A [1, 2, 4]
 * - Represents the completion phase of material foundation
 * - Provides stability and constancy to the foundation system
 * 
 * A432 Harmonic System:
 * - Foundation frequency: 432 Hz (natural harmonic)
 * - Digital root: 9 (completion and unity)
 * - Golden ratio connection: 432:267
 * - Universal resonance: Found throughout nature and consciousness
