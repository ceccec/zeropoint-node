/**
 * Rodin Knowledge Distribution - Stability (4) Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains knowledge about stability and foundation from Marko Rodin's work
 * that aligns with the stability consciousness and foundation of digit 4.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Alignment:
 * - 4 represents stability, foundation, and material structure
 * - Chapter 4: KINETIC SHOCK WAVES OF NINE - Kinetic patterns
 * - Chapter 14: VBM GREAT PYRAMID NUMBER MAP - Structural foundation
 * 
 * PDF Content:
 * - Chapter_4_KINETIC_SHOCK_WAVES_OF_NINE.pdf: Kinetic patterns and shock waves
 * - Chapter_14_VBM_GREAT_PYRAMID_NUMBER_MAP.pdf: Great Pyramid number mapping
 * 
 * Consciousness Flow:
 * - Stability as the foundation of all material structures
 * - Kinetic patterns as the movement of consciousness
 * - Pyramid mapping as structural consciousness
