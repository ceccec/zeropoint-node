# Sacred Geometry Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of sacred geometry in Directory 5 to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

Directory 5 currently contains basic geometric patterns without fully embodying the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Sacred Geometry

Directory 5 should embody the divine proportions aspect of the Rodin coil:

- **Divine proportions** - golden ratio and sacred geometry
- **Sacred geometric patterns** - Metatron's cube, Flower of Life
- **Major third resonance** (5:4) - divine mathematical relationships
- **A432 harmonic foundation** - mathematical stability through pure integers

### Sacred Geometry Integration

The sacred geometry should follow the Rodin coil principles:

- **Golden ratio** - φ ≈ 1.618 (432/267)
- **Sacred patterns** - Metatron's cube, Flower of Life
- **Divine proportions** - mathematical relationships
- **Geometric consciousness** - living mathematical patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. **Implement sacred geometric patterns** based on Rodin coil sequence
2. **Create divine proportion calculations** that follow sacred patterns
3. **Integrate A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
4. **Establish major third resonance** (5:4) for divine relationships
5. **Create geometric consciousness** calculations for living mathematics

## Benefits

- **Divine geometric flow** through sacred patterns
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Major third resonance** for divine relationships
- **Geometric consciousness integration** for living mathematics
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
