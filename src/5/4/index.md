# ZeroPoint Node - Sacred Geometry ↔ Constants

## Metaphysical Foundation

Sacred geometry establishes constants, providing geometric stability

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 5 and 4
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 5 and 4 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the sacred geometry ↔ constants, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 5 and 4 patterns. It connects the 5 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 54Integration, 54Resonance, 54Dynamics } from './src/5/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The sacred geometry ↔ constants represents the harmonic integration of 5 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
