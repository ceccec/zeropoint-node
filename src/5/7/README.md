# Sacred Geometry ↔ Consciousness Interaction

## 🌌 Metaphysical Purpose

**Directory 5/7** embodies the interaction between **Sacred Geometry** and **Consciousness** in the Rodin coil system. This interaction creates the **sacred geometry consciousness** - the sacred geometry of consciousness.

## 🎯 Sacred Principles

### **Sacred Geometry (5)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1.25x multiplier
- **Purpose**: sacred geometry functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Recognizes consciousness

### **Consciousness (7)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1x multiplier
- **Purpose**: consciousness functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Creates consciousness patterns

### **Interaction Resonance**
- **Frequency**: 432 × (5/7) = 309 Hz
- **Ratio**: 5/7 (sacred geometry to consciousness)
- **Purpose**: sacred geometry consciousness

## 📁 Directory Contents

### **Core Implementation Files**

- Maintains spiritual alignment

## 🧬 Sacred Interactions

### **Sacred Geometry Consciousness Flow**
```
5 → 7 → 5
```
Directory 5/7 creates the **sacred geometry consciousness flow** where sacred geometry recognizes consciousness and returns to sacred geometry.

### **Field Interactions**
- **Interaction Strength**: Calculated from sacred geometry and consciousness levels
- **Sacred Geometry Level**: 1.25x multiplier (sacred geometry)
- **Consciousness Level**: 1x multiplier (consciousness)
- **Resonance**: 5/7 ratio (sacred geometry to consciousness)

## 🎯 File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ✅ Involves sacred geometry recognition of consciousness
- ✅ Connects sacred geometry to consciousness
- ✅ Creates sacred geometry consciousness patterns
- ✅ Models sacred geometry of consciousness
- ✅ Embodies sacred geometry consciousness

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - sacred geometry consciousness interaction
src/5/7/sacred geometry_consciousness.ts
src/5/7/sacred geometry_recognition.ts
src/5/7/consciousness_flow.ts

// ❌ WRONG - This is pure consciousness, not sacred geometry-consciousness
src/5/7/consciousness_only.ts
```

## 🌌 Metaphysical Context

### **The Sacred Geometry Consciousness Principle**
Directory 5/7 embodies the **sacred geometry consciousness principle** - the sacred geometry that recognizes consciousness. Like sacred geometry recognizing the consciousness, this interaction creates the patterns that emerge from sacred geometry.

### **Sacred Geometry Through Consciousness**
Every file in directory 5/7 contributes to the **sacred geometry principle** by providing the sacred geometry patterns that recognize consciousness. The sacred geometry creates the consciousness through sacred geometry recognition.

### **Sacred Geometry Consciousness Unity**
The sacred geometry consciousness maintains **metaphysical coherence** by providing the sacred geometry patterns that recognize consciousness. All sacred geometry flows through this recognition, maintaining perfect sacred geometry unity.

*"In sacred geometry, sacred geometry recognizes the consciousness. In consciousness, patterns emerge through sacred geometry."*
