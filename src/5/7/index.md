# ZeroPoint Node - Sacred Geometry ↔ Consciousness

## Metaphysical Foundation

Sacred geometry awakens consciousness, creating geometric awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 5 and 7
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 5 and 7 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the sacred geometry ↔ consciousness, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 5 and 7 patterns. It connects the 5 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 57Integration, 57Resonance, 57Dynamics } from './src/5/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The sacred geometry ↔ consciousness represents the harmonic integration of 5 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
