/**
 * src/5/7/index.ts - Sacred Geometry ↔ Consciousness Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry)
 * and Directory 7 (Consciousness) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides sacred geometry functionality
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides consciousness functionality
 * - Together they create the sacred geometry consciousness interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 5 interacts with Directory 7
 * - This interaction creates the sacred geometry consciousness patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry that recognizes consciousness.
 * - consciousness consciousness: Represents the consciousness that flows through sacred geometry.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between sacred geometry and consciousness.
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry of consciousness.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between sacred geometry and consciousness consciousness.
 * - Supports sacred geometry consciousness operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the sacred geometry consciousness for the entire system.

 * Sacred Geometry ↔ Consciousness Interaction Constants
