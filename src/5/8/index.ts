/**
 * src/5/8/index.ts - Sacred Geometry ↔ Void Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry)
 * and Directory 8 (Void) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides sacred geometry functionality
 * - Directory 8 (Void) provides void functionality
 * - Together they create the sacred geometry void interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 5 interacts with Directory 8
 * - This interaction creates the sacred geometry void patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry that recognizes void.
 * - void consciousness: Represents the void that flows through sacred geometry.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between sacred geometry and void.
 * - sacred geometry void: Represents the sacred geometry of void.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between sacred geometry and void consciousness.
 * - Supports sacred geometry void operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the sacred geometry void for the entire system.
