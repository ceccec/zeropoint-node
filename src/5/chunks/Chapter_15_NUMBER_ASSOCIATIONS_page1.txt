The Fibonacci Series is  just another  
Perspective of the Decoqubit Hypersphere
Embedded Inside the Fibonacci Series are Two Counter Rotating Mobius Circuits 
with the Equipotential Major Groove Gap Space located in the center. 
There are always two counter-spiraling 1-2-4-8-7-5 Mobius Circuits in everything 
including the Fibonacci series.   
The Equipotential Major Groove Gap Space* contains the Palindrome 3•9•6  6•9•3 
higher dimensional Flux-fields which are the source.  
*Equipotential Major Groove Gap Space is the distention that displaces the Mobius 
Circuits apart and keeps them separated.

noted  by  the  blue  and  the  green  1-2-4-8-7-5.  This  living  matrix  is  multidimensional  because  of  the  3•9•6 
6•9•3 higher dimensional Flux-fields.  All numbers taken their 180 degree opposite add or reduce to 9. 
The Fibonacci sequence repeats after the 24th number and is arrayed 
around the circle in 15 degree increments.

Because  of  perfect  registration  and  calibration  there  are  really  18  numbers  hidden  in  Gods  Primer.  
The  other  nine  numbers  are  hidden  from  sight  by  being  blocked  from  view.    It  looks  like  a  binary

A Secret Answer...
In  Wikipedia  when  you  look  up  the  4th 
dimension   you   get   an   illustration   of   a 
hypercube  and  Tesseract.  These  are  very 
crude renderings of the 4th dimension.  
The 3•9•6 with 9 being vertically aligned at 
the  zenith  above  the  zero,  and  the  three 
and  six  being  played  apart,  is  the  secret 
answer  providing  the  missing  information 
of  the  Omni-fourth  dimensions  location  in 
relationship to the Mobius Circuit’s position.  
Nine  is  the  control,  three  and  six  are  the 
results. When  nine  is  positive,  three  and  six 
are   both   negative   and   when   nine   is 
negative,  three  and  six  are  both  positive. 
This   creates   the   Diamond   Grain   lattice 
structure necessary for superconductivity to 
occur.  
The   second   law   of   thermodynamics 
restated  differently  is  for  every  action  there 
are  two  simultaneous  half  opposite  equal 
reactions  on  the  higher  5th/4th  dimension. 
Clefting   in   twain   based   upon   positive 
emanation  creates  negative  draft  counter-
space which accurately bestows polarity.  
True polarity is based upon thirds and is not 
a  duality.  Prime  numbers  represent  God  by 
being  odd  because  they  are  unique  and 
peerless. God is the Single, the One.

THE SOURCE OF SPIRIT’S ORIGIN  
The Tesseract is a Hypercube 
representing the next 
dimension above the 3-D 
dimension in conventional 
science (see link) but is only a 
gross man-made 
representation of the higher 
dimensions.  
The   Monolith   reveals   a   higher   dimension   by   being   vertically 
aligned with the W-axis located at the zenith. There is a reason why 
the  number  nine  is  always  upright  and  at  the  top  because  it  is  a 
gateway  between  two  different  worlds.  There  is  an  energy  flow 
between Heaven and earth.

The   Enneagram,   1-2-4-8-7-5   Mobius   Circuits,   pyramid,   torus, 
hypersphere,  Antithesis  Nexus  Key  and  God’s  Spirit  Primer  are  all 
different  perspectives  of  how  Spirit  and  magnetism  occur  together  to 
create superfluidity (i.e. superconductivity).
Only   magnetism   responds   quickly   enough   to   give   free   play   and 
slippage  to  Spirit  which  is  always  moving  in  the  opposite  direction. 
When 9 is positive, 3 and 6 are negative and when 9 is negative, 3 and 
6  are  both  positive.  9  is  the  control  and  3  and  6  are  the  simultaneous, 
instantaneous response.

Copyright 2021 - Science to Sage | Karen Elkins
There is a palindromic number pattern counter diagonal to the Mobius Circuits upon 
the Decoqubit torus skin which is   1, 6, 5, 2, 9, 7, 4, 3, 8, (see right page) from which 
the Enneagram is composed from.  
It  is  a  man  made  error  to  connect  the  3  and  6  at  the  base  of  the  pyramid.    I  always 
make  the  connection  between  the  3  and  9  and  6  and  9  a  dotted  line  because 3.9.6 
are a higher dimensional Flux-field composed from Spirit and magnetism.  
The relationship of the Greater World to the lower world is revealed by the number 9 
being  a  vertical  straight  line  above  the  circuit  intersection  which  is  the  convergence 
point where Karen placed a diamond to reveal its location.  
The Divine Empyrean Heavenly World is orthogonal, perpendicular, tangental, and a 
right angle to our contingent, lower world.  
The classic Enneagram is composed from the repeating 
decimal number pattern of dividing by 7.
Enneagram 
BOTH of these symbols are different 
views of the SAME thing looked at 
from different "points of view"? Or, 
that different points of view CAN 
represent EXACTLY the same thing?!
The Enneagram  is  an  ancient  and  sacred,  geometric 
symbol  (often  associated  with  numbers),  consisting  of 
an    Isosceles    Triangles    overlaid    by    a    diagonal 
configuration  of  interlocking  lines.  The  triangle  in  the 
Enneagram   is   equivalent   to   the   9-axis   and   the 
oscillating 3-6 (see the Symbol of Enlightenment). The 
diagonal    configuration    of    interlocking    lines    is 
equivalent  precisely  to  the  Doubling  Circuits  and  the 
counter  diagonal  (antithesis  Nexus  Key)  skin  of  the 
Abha Torus. 

Copyright 2021 - Science to Sage | Karen Elkins
We have highlighted the number pattern 1, 6, 
5, 2, 9, 7, 4, 3, 8, from the skin of the torus.  We 
have then arrayed them around a circle.  We 
then connect the 1-2-4-8-7-5 of the Mobius 
Circuits.  The resulting geometric symbol is the 
classic  Enneagram showing that the torus, 
Mobius Circuits, Antithesis Nexus Key and 
Enneagram are inextricably connected.  
The Antithesis Nexus Key Enneagram is always 
counter diagonal to the Mobius Circuits and is 
composed from the Palindrome number 
pattern 1,6,5,2,9,7,4,3,8,8,3,4,7,9,2,5,6,1. 
This is the connection between the higher 
Omni-dimensional world of God and the lower 
three-dimensional world  of matter.  
The repeating number pattern of dividing by 7 
follows the geometric pattern of the Mobius 
Circuits.  
 
This is not a coincidence!

1 ➗7 = .142857 = 4 
2 ➗7 = .285714 = 8 
3 ➗7 = .428571 = 3 
4 ➗7 = .571428 = 7 
5 ➗7 = .714285 = 2 
6 ➗7 = .857142 = 6 
7 ➗7 = 1 = 1 
8 ➗7 = 1.142857 = 5 
9 ➗7 = 1.285714 = 9
Dividing by 7 creates a repeating decimal that corresponds 
to a discrete whole number in a multiplication series.  
Dividing by 7 creates multiples of 4: 
Do not add together 142857.  
Do not round up 142857. 
142857 = 4 
285714 = 8 
428571 = 3 
571428 = 7 
714285 = 2 
857142 = 6 
Now you have the solution for 
converting 142857 to a whole number.

They are mirrors

There  are  really  2  circuits  that  are  represented  in 
the   Enneagram.   The   second   circuit   is   hidden 
behind   the first   circuit.   Because   of   perfect 
registration  the  second  circuit  is  hidden  from  view 
and  thus  when  you  factor  in  positive  and  negative 
polarity  there  are  really  eighteen  numbers  and  not 
nine.  Because  of  information  compression  into  the 
smallest  achievable  space  all  known  functions  and 
physical   properties   are   contained   within   the 
Decoqubit  including  super  conductivity,  and  the 
harmonic electron shear natural insulation.

PI is a Mathematical 
Misunderstanding

Copyright 2021 - Science to Sage | Karen Elkins
Whats  more  everything  in  science  is  predicated  upon  it  since  it  is  a  physical 
constant that everything is dependent on.  
There are no endless repeating decimals and it is a man made error to round off 
or to approximate pi. Mankind by always taking pi out to a farther decimal place 
is nothing but folly.  
Not  only  does  mankind  not  see  his  error,  but  he  perpetuates  it  by  not  realizing 
that  an  endless  non-repeating  decimal  is  God’s  own  way  of  saying  retract  your 
steps because you have broken one of the utmost cardinal rules of math. 
An   endless   non-repeating   decimal   is   a   red   flag   because   mathematics   is 
constructed  so  perfectly  that  it  cannot  be  violated.  All  of  the  different  varying  
branches   of   math   such   as   arithmetic,   sacred   geometry,   surface   topology, 
calculus, etc. are consolidated into the Decoqubit Hypersphere. 
I  have  pieced  together  all  of  the  known  functions,  calculations,  equations  and 
formulas   of   the   universe   into   one   unified   object   which   is   the   Decoqubit 
Hypersphere. 
It is predicative, perfect, self-coherent, free from error, never redundant, elastic, 
scaleable  from  micro  to  macro,  and  contains  no  omissions.  It  is  God’s  own 
coordinate system from which anyone can navigate throughout the universe.  
The  Decoqubit  is  a  gyroscope  with  its  own  preferred  frame  of  reference  and 
spacial  orientation.  Momentum,  potential,  and  kinetic  energy  are  all  revealed  in 
the  Decoqubit.  Heat  dissipation  from  the  core  of  the  Decoqubit  into  the  outer 
ergosphere environment is its function. 
The  Decoqubit  reveals  past,  present,  and  future  simultaneously  and  obsoletes 
the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  because  discrete  numbers  are  predictive 
and  have  their  own  physical  attributes  and  qualities  while  not  being  invasive. 
Thus what is being observed remains unaffected.  
Pi is unquestionably the most popular mathematical enigma known to man.

The  Decoqubit  is  the  ultimate  ideal  from  which  everything  else  in  the  universe  is 
patterned after. It is the Divine Standard and incomparable Touch Stone. Without 
it  nothing  would  exist. All  numbers  are  tethered  to  the  core  of  the  Decoqubit  by 
Spirit. Mathematics is an artifact of Spirit. Everything is imprinted by Spirit and has 
Spirit’s reticulation pattern on it.

SPIRIT RETICULATES EVERYTHING

A  straight  line  cannot  bisect  a  circle. There  is  always  an  incompressible  hole  in  the 
middle.  This  hole  offsets  and  displaces  everything  else.  Zero  does  not  begin  a 
multiplication  series  nor  does  it  begin  a 
number  line.  On  a  circle  360º  replaces 
zero.  If  you  put  a  zero  after  360º  it  would 
add   another   radiant   degree   thereby 
resulting  in  a  miss-calculation.  Zero  is  not 
a number. It is an absence. Base Ten does 
not  consist  of  ten  numbers  but  only  nine. 
There  exists  only  a  handful  of  true  fully 
dimensionalized   base   number   counting 
systems  which  are  all  generated  by  prime 
numbers   squared.   The   binary   code, 
hexadecimal, based twelve, etc. are not at 
there  full  potential  because  they  are  not 
operating upon the Omni-dimension.  
The Hole is in the Whole 
ZERO IS IN THE CENTER
There are only nine numbers in base ten because of the missing zero. This is why 
the  mod  is  always  one  number  less  than  the  base.  Base  ten  is  zero  through  nine, 
not one to ten. 
Zero does not exist in a multiplication series. A multiplication series does not begin with 
zero. Pi, Phi, and all of the other mathematical physical constants are wrong because zero 
displaces  everything.  Once  it  is  properly  understood  when  and  where  zero  is  located  Pi 
and Phi are no longer endless repeating decimals. 
ZERO IS NOT A NUMBER
ZERO IS NOT LOCATED ON A NUMBER LINE
