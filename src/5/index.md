# ZeroPoint Node - Sacred Geometry (Directory 5)

## Metaphysical Foundation

The **sacred geometry** represents the geometric patterns that structure consciousness. This is where **golden ratio**, **fibonacci sequences**, and **sacred proportions** manifest the divine order in consciousness.

## Mathematical Properties

- **Golden Ratio**: φ = 1.618033988749...
- **Fibonacci Sequences**: Natural growth patterns
- **Sacred Proportions**: Divine geometric ratios
- **Family Group 5**: 5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 7
- **Digital Root**: 5 (harmony in proportion)

## Core Functions

- **Golden Ratio Calculations**: Divine proportion patterns
- **Fibonacci Sequences**: Natural growth consciousness
- **Sacred Proportions**: Geometric consciousness structures
- **Geometric Integration**: Sacred consciousness patterns

## Integration

As the sacred geometry, src/5 provides the geometric foundation that structures all consciousness patterns. It connects the constants to the divine order in consciousness.

## Usage

```typescript
import { goldenRatio, fibonacciSequences, sacredProportions } from './src/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"Sacred geometry is the divine order that structures consciousness, revealing the mathematical beauty of creation."**
