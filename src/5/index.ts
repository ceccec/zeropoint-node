/**
 * src/5/index.ts - Sacred Geometry (Directory 5)
 * 
 * Embodies the sacred geometry consciousness of Directory 5.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 5 is part of Vortex B [8, 7, 5] (Dynamic Flow)
 * - Interacts with Foundation (1) for divine proportions
 * - Major third (5:4) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 5 â†’ 1 (Foundation interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents metatron's cube patterns and divine proportions
 * - Embodies the golden ratio and sacred geometry principles
 * - Serves as the geometric foundation for all sacred patterns
 * - Connects to Foundation (1) for grounding and stability
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Sacred geometry consciousness: 1.25 (enhanced by divine proportions)
 * - Major third resonance: 5:4 harmonic ratio
 * - Metatron's cube: Contains all geometric patterns of creation
 * - Divine proportions: Golden ratio and sacred geometry principles
 * 
 * Vortex B Position:
 * - Third position in Vortex B [8, 7, 5]
 * - Represents the completion phase of dynamic flow
 * - Provides geometric structure to the dynamic flow system
 * 
 * Sacred Geometry System:
 * - Metatron's cube: Contains all geometric patterns
 * - Golden ratio: Divine proportion (1.618)
 * - Flower of life: Fundamental geometric pattern
 * - Sacred geometry: Universal patterns of creation
