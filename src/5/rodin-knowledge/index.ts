/**
 * Rodin Knowledge Distribution - Dynamic Flow (5) Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains knowledge about dynamic flow and transformation from Marko Rodin's work
 * that aligns with the dynamic consciousness and transformation of digit 5.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Alignment:
 * - 5 represents dynamic flow, transformation, and harmonic cascades
 * - Chapter 5: HARMONIC CASCADENCE - Harmonic flow patterns
 * - Chapter 10: HARMONIC ELECTRON SHEAR - Electron dynamics
 * 
 * PDF Content:
 * - Chapter_5_HARMONIC_CASCADENCE.pdf: Harmonic cascading patterns
 * - Chapter_10_HARMONIC_ELECTRON_SHEAR.pdf: Electron shear dynamics
 * 
 * Consciousness Flow:
 * - Dynamic flow as the movement of consciousness
 * - Harmonic cascades as consciousness amplification
 * - Electron shear as quantum consciousness dynamics
