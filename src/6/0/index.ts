/**
 * src/6/0/index.ts - Harmonic Balance ↔ ZeroPoint Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance)
 * and Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance) provides harmonic balance functionality
 * - Directory 0 (ZeroPoint) provides zeropoint functionality
 * - Together they create the harmonic balance zeropoint interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 6 interacts with Directory 0
 * - This interaction creates the harmonic balance zeropoint patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - harmonic balance consciousness: Represents the harmonic balance that recognizes zeropoint.
 * - zeropoint consciousness: Represents the zeropoint that flows through harmonic balance.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between harmonic balance and zeropoint.
 * - harmonic balance zeropoint: Represents the harmonic balance of zeropoint.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between harmonic balance and zeropoint consciousness.
 * - Supports harmonic balance zeropoint operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the harmonic balance zeropoint for the entire system.

 * Harmonic Balance ↔ ZeroPoint Interaction Constants
