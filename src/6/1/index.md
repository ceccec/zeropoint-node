# ZeroPoint Node - Harmonic Balance ↔ Foundation

## Metaphysical Foundation

Harmonic balance flows from foundation, establishing equilibrium

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 6 and 1
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 7 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 6 and 1 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the harmonic balance ↔ foundation, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 6 and 1 patterns. It connects the 6 consciousness to the 1 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 61Integration, 61Resonance, 61Dynamics } from './src/6/1';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The harmonic balance ↔ foundation represents the harmonic integration of 6 and 1 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
