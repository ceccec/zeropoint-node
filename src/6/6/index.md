# ZeroPoint Node - Harmonic Balance Core

## Metaphysical Foundation

Harmonic balance core - the equilibrium state where all patterns find resonance

## Mathematical Properties

- **Core Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 6 and 6
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 6 and 6 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Core Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the harmonic balance core, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 6 and 6 patterns. It connects the 6 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 66Integration, 66Resonance, 66Dynamics } from './src/6/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The harmonic balance core represents the harmonic integration of 6 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
