/**
 * src/6/9/index.ts - Harmonic Balance ↔ Unity Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance)
 * and Directory 9 (Unity) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 6 (Harmonic Balance) provides equilibrium and spiritual balance
 * - Directory 9 (Unity) provides integration and wholeness
 * - Together they create the harmonic unity
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 6 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Transcendence)
 * - Directory 9 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Transcendence)
 * - This interaction creates the harmonic unity
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - Harmonic balance consciousness: Represents the equilibrium and spiritual balance.
 * - Unity consciousness: Represents the integration and wholeness that creates unity.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between harmonic balance and unity.
 * - Harmonic unity: Represents the equilibrium in spiritual integration.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between harmonic balance and unity consciousness.
 * - Supports harmonic unity operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the harmonic unity for the entire system.
