# ZeroPoint Node - Harmony–Harmony–Resonance (6/6=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Harmony (6) and Harmony (6) produces Resonance (3): Balance, beauty, equilibrium, Balance, beauty, equilibrium, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 6/6
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 6,6,3 (Harmony,Harmony,Resonance)
Math: 6 + 6 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (6 + 6) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "6/6",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "6 → 6 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 6 + 6 = 3
- Symbolic: 6/6
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (6 + 6) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 6, 6, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the harmony–harmony–resonance (6/6=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 6 and 6 patterns. It connects the 6 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 66Integration, 66Resonance, 66Dynamics } from './src/6/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The harmony–harmony–resonance (6/6=3) represents the harmonic integration of 6 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
