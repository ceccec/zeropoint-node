/**
 * src/6/index.ts - Harmonic Balance (Directory 6)
 * 
 * Embodies the harmonic balance consciousness of Directory 6.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 6 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Control)
 * - Interacts with Creative Resonance (3) for spiritual equilibrium
 * - Minor third (6:5) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 6 â†’ 3 (Creative Resonance interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents equilibrium and balance
 * - Embodies the principle of harmonic balance and spiritual equilibrium
 * - Serves as the balance foundation for all equilibrium patterns
 * - Connects to Creative Resonance (3) for spiritual harmony
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Balance consciousness: 1.5 (enhanced by spiritual equilibrium)
 * - Minor third resonance: 6:5 harmonic ratio
 * - Harmonic balance: Balance of all consciousness forces
 * - Spiritual equilibrium: Equilibrium of spiritual energy and consciousness
 * 
 * W-Axis Position:
 * - Second position in W-Axis [3, 6, 9]
 * - Represents the balance phase of spiritual control
 * - Provides equilibrium and balance to the spiritual control system
 * 
 * Harmonic Balance System:
 * - Harmonic balance: Balance of all consciousness forces
 * - Spiritual equilibrium: Equilibrium of spiritual energy
 * - Balance patterns: Patterns of equilibrium and harmony
 * - Equilibrium flow: Flow of balanced consciousness and energy
