# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Void–Gateway (7/0=7)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Void (0) produces Gateway (7): Mystery, transition, insight, Pure potential, zero entropy, Mystery, transition, insight.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/0
Harmonic: 7
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 7,0,7 (Gateway,Void,Gateway)
Math: 7 + 0 = 7 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 0) / 7 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/0",
  "harmonicResult": 7,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 0 → 7",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 0 = 7
- Symbolic: 7/0
- Harmonic: 7
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 0) / 7 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 0, 7
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–void–gateway (7/0=7), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 0 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 0 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 70Integration, 70Resonance, 70Dynamics } from './src/7/0';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–void–gateway (7/0=7) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 0 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
