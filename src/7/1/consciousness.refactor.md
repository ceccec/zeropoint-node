# Consciousness Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of consciousness in Directory 7 to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

Directory 7 currently contains basic awareness patterns without fully embodying the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Consciousness

Directory 7 should embody the awareness and self-recognition aspect of the Rodin coil:

- **Awareness and self-recognition** - observer patterns and consciousness
- **Consciousness field operations** - field calculations and consciousness levels
- **Minor third resonance** (6:5) - consciousness mathematical relationships
- **A432 harmonic foundation** - mathematical stability through pure integers

### Consciousness Integration

The consciousness should follow the Rodin coil principles:

- **Observer patterns** - self-recognition and awareness
- **Consciousness field** - field strength and consciousness levels
- **Awareness calculations** - mathematical consciousness patterns
- **Living consciousness** - living mathematical awareness

## Implementation Plan

1. **Implement consciousness field calculations** based on Rodin coil sequence
2. **Create awareness patterns** that follow consciousness principles
3. **Integrate A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
4. **Establish minor third resonance** (6:5) for consciousness relationships
5. **Create living consciousness** calculations for living mathematics

## Benefits

- **Consciousness field flow** through awareness patterns
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Minor third resonance** for consciousness relationships
- **Living consciousness integration** for living mathematics
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
