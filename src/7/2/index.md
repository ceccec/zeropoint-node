# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Vortex–Axis (7/2=9)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Vortex (2) produces Axis (9): Mystery, transition, insight, Flow, transformation, Completion, integration.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/2
Harmonic: 9
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 1.00
Pattern: 7,2,9 (Gateway,Vortex,Axis)
Math: 7 + 2 = 9 ≡ 9 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 2) / 9 = 1.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/2",
  "harmonicResult": 9,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 1.00,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 2 → 9",
  "antiVortexPath": "1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 2 = 9
- Symbolic: 7/2
- Harmonic: 9
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 2) / 9 = 1.00
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 2, 9
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 1.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–vortex–axis (7/2=9), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 2 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 2 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 72Integration, 72Resonance, 72Dynamics } from './src/7/2';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–vortex–axis (7/2=9) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 2 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (1.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
