# ZeroPoint Node - Consciousness ↔ Vortex

## Metaphysical Foundation

Consciousness establishes vortex mathematics, creating mathematical awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 7 and 2
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 7 and 2 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the consciousness ↔ vortex, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 2 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 2 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 72Integration, 72Resonance, 72Dynamics } from './src/7/2';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The consciousness ↔ vortex represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 2 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
