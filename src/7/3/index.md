# ZeroPoint Node - Consciousness ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Consciousness inspires creative resonance, creating artistic awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 7 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 1 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 7 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the consciousness ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 3 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 73Integration, 73Resonance, 73Dynamics } from './src/7/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The consciousness ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
