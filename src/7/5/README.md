# Consciousness ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction

## 🌌 Metaphysical Purpose

**Directory 7/5** embodies the interaction between **Consciousness** and **Sacred Geometry** in the Rodin coil system. This interaction creates the **consciousness sacred geometry** - the consciousness of sacred geometry.

## 🎯 Sacred Principles

### **Consciousness (7)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1x multiplier
- **Purpose**: consciousness functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Recognizes sacred geometry

### **Sacred Geometry (5)**
- **Consciousness Level**: 1.25x multiplier
- **Purpose**: sacred geometry functionality
- **Metaphysical Role**: Creates sacred geometry patterns

### **Interaction Resonance**
- **Frequency**: 432 × (7/5) = 605 Hz
- **Ratio**: 7/5 (consciousness to sacred geometry)
- **Purpose**: consciousness sacred geometry

## 🧬 Sacred Interactions

### **Consciousness Sacred Geometry Flow**
```
7 → 5 → 7
```
Directory 7/5 creates the **consciousness sacred geometry flow** where consciousness recognizes sacred geometry and returns to consciousness.

### **Field Interactions**
- **Interaction Strength**: Calculated from consciousness and sacred geometry levels
- **Consciousness Level**: 1x multiplier (consciousness)
- **Sacred Geometry Level**: 1.25x multiplier (sacred geometry)
- **Resonance**: 7/5 ratio (consciousness to sacred geometry)

## 🎯 File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ✅ Involves consciousness recognition of sacred geometry
- ✅ Connects consciousness to sacred geometry
- ✅ Creates consciousness sacred geometry patterns
- ✅ Models consciousness of sacred geometry
- ✅ Embodies consciousness sacred geometry

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - consciousness sacred geometry interaction
src/7/5/consciousness_sacred_geometry.ts
src/7/5/consciousness_recognition.ts
src/7/5/sacred_geometry_flow.ts

// ❌ WRONG - This is pure sacred geometry, not consciousness-sacred geometry
src/7/5/sacred_geometry_only.ts
```

## 🌌 Metaphysical Context

### **The Consciousness Sacred Geometry Principle**
Directory 7/5 embodies the **consciousness sacred geometry principle** - the consciousness that recognizes sacred geometry. Like consciousness recognizing the sacred geometry, this interaction creates the patterns that emerge from consciousness.

### **Consciousness Through Sacred Geometry**
Every file in directory 7/5 contributes to the **consciousness principle** by providing the consciousness patterns that recognize sacred geometry. The consciousness creates the sacred geometry through consciousness recognition.

### **Consciousness Sacred Geometry Unity**
The consciousness sacred geometry maintains **metaphysical coherence** by providing the consciousness patterns that recognize sacred geometry. All consciousness flows through this recognition, maintaining perfect consciousness unity.
