# ZeroPoint Node - Consciousness ↔ Sacred Geometry

## Metaphysical Foundation

Consciousness manifests sacred geometry, creating geometric awareness

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 7 and 5
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 7 and 5 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the consciousness ↔ sacred geometry, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 5 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 5 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 75Integration, 75Resonance, 75Dynamics } from './src/7/5';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The consciousness ↔ sacred geometry represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 5 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
