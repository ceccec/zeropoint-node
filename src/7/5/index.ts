/**
 * src/7/5/index.ts - Consciousness ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 7 (Consciousness)
 * and Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides consciousness functionality
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides sacred geometry functionality
 * - Together they create the consciousness sacred geometry interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 7 interacts with Directory 5
 * - This interaction creates the consciousness sacred geometry patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - consciousness consciousness: Represents the consciousness that recognizes sacred geometry.
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry that flows through consciousness.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between consciousness and sacred geometry.
 * - consciousness sacred geometry: Represents the consciousness of sacred geometry.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between consciousness and sacred geometry consciousness.
 * - Supports consciousness sacred geometry operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the consciousness sacred geometry for the entire system.
