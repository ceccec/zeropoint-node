# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Gateway–Center (7/7=5)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Gateway (7) produces Center (5): Mystery, transition, insight, Mystery, transition, insight, Change, flow, balance.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/7
Harmonic: 5
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.80
Pattern: 7,7,5 (Gateway,Gateway,Center)
Math: 7 + 7 = 14 ≡ 5 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 7) / 5 = 2.80


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/7",
  "harmonicResult": 5,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 2.80,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 7 → 5",
  "antiVortexPath": "2.80 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 7 = 5
- Symbolic: 7/7
- Harmonic: 5
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 7) / 5 = 2.80
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 7, 5
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.80 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–gateway–center (7/7=5), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 7 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 7 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 77Integration, 77Resonance, 77Dynamics } from './src/7/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–gateway–center (7/7=5) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 7 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.80) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
