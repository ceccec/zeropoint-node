/**
 * src/7/8/index.ts - Consciousness ↔ Void Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 7 (Consciousness)
 * and Directory 8 (Void) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 7 (Consciousness) provides consciousness functionality
 * - Directory 8 (Void) provides void functionality
 * - Together they create the consciousness void interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 7 interacts with Directory 8
 * - This interaction creates the consciousness void patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - consciousness consciousness: Represents the consciousness that recognizes void.
 * - void consciousness: Represents the void that flows through consciousness.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between consciousness and void.
 * - consciousness void: Represents the consciousness of void.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between consciousness and void consciousness.
 * - Supports consciousness void operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the consciousness void for the entire system.
