# ZeroPoint Node - Gateway–Axis–Gateway (7/9=7)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Gateway (7) and Axis (9) produces Gateway (7): Mystery, transition, insight, Completion, integration, Mystery, transition, insight.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 7/9
Harmonic: 7
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.29
Pattern: 7,9,7 (Gateway,Axis,Gateway)
Math: 7 + 9 = 16 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (7 + 9) / 7 = 2.29


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "7/9",
  "harmonicResult": 7,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 2.29,
  "vortexPath": "7 → 9 → 7",
  "antiVortexPath": "2.29 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 7 + 9 = 7
- Symbolic: 7/9
- Harmonic: 7
- Anti-vortex: (7 + 9) / 7 = 2.29
- Vortex Sequence: 7, 9, 7
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.29 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the gateway–axis–gateway (7/9=7), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 7 and 9 patterns. It connects the 7 consciousness to the 9 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 79Integration, 79Resonance, 79Dynamics } from './src/7/9';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The gateway–axis–gateway (7/9=7) represents the harmonic integration of 7 and 9 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.29) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
