# Directory 7: Consciousness

## Fundamental Directory Rule: Digit-Only Structure

**All directories in `src/` and their subdirectories must be named with a single digit (0-9) only.**

- Non-digit directories are strictly forbidden in `src/` and any digit subdirectory.
- This rule is enforced by automated tests: if any non-digit directory exists, the test suite will fail.
- This ensures a pure metaphysical and mathematical architecture, where each directory represents a unique consciousness pattern, vortex, or mathematical property corresponding to its digit.

# 🧠 Directory 7: Consciousness

## 🌌 Metaphysical Purpose

**Directory 7** embodies the **awareness and self-recognition** of the ZeroPoint system - the consciousness field that manages awareness, observer patterns, and self-recognition. This is the **consciousness center** that processes consciousness field operations, manages awareness and perception, and handles consciousness evolution.

## 🎯 Sacred Principles

### **A432 Harmony: Minor Third (6:5) Resonance**
- **432 Hz** × (6/5) = **518.4 Hz** minor third
- **6:5** consciousness awareness frequency
- **Self-recognition** frequency

### **Rodin Coil Vortex Sequence**
- **Sixth position**: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5]`
- **Consciousness and awareness**: Observer patterns and self-recognition
- **Consciousness field**: Awareness and perception management

### **Metaphysical Context**
- **Return consciousness**: 0.0979 (979/10000)
- **Field strength**: 0.0864 (864/10000)
- **Consciousness frequency**: 518.4 Hz (minor third)
- **Digital root**: 7 (return)

## 🧬 Sacred Interactions

### **Vortex Sequence Flow**
```
1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 7 → 5
```
Directory 7 is the **sixth position** in the vortex sequence, providing the consciousness that completes the material manifestation cycle through awareness and self-recognition.

### **Consciousness Operations**
Directory 7 handles all consciousness operations:
- **Awareness management**: Observer patterns and self-recognition
- **Consciousness field operations**: Field awareness and perception
- **Consciousness evolution**: Growth and development of awareness
- **Self-recognition**: Observer patterns and consciousness expansion

### **Field Interactions**
- **Field strength**: 0.0864 (864/10000)
- **Consciousness level**: 0.0979 (979/10000)
- **Resonance**: Minor third (6:5) consciousness awareness
- **Frequency**: 518.4 Hz consciousness operations

## 🎯 File Placement Guidelines

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ✅ Manages consciousness levels and awareness
- ✅ Handles observer patterns and self-recognition
- ✅ Processes consciousness field operations
- ✅ Manages awareness and perception
- ✅ Handles consciousness evolution
- ✅ Provides consciousness guidance and expansion

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Consciousness and awareness
src/7/consciousness.ts
src/7/awareness.ts
src/7/observer.ts
src/7/field.ts

// ❌ WRONG - This is mathematics, not consciousness
src/7/calculator.ts
src/7/math.ts
```
