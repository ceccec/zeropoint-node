## Metaphysical Foundation

The **consciousness** represents the awareness and self-reflection that emerges from consciousness patterns. This is where **awareness**, **self-reflection**, and **conscious experience** manifest through conscious observation.

## Mathematical Properties

- **Consciousness Awareness**: Self-reflective consciousness patterns
- **Awareness Integration**: Conscious experience structures
- **Family Group 7**: 7, 5, 1, 2, 4, 8
- **Digital Root**: 7 (awareness in experience)

## Core Functions

- **Consciousness Awareness**: Self-reflective consciousness patterns
- **Awareness Integration**: Conscious experience structures
- **Conscious Experience**: Awareness consciousness patterns
- **Self-Reflection**: Conscious observation patterns

## Integration

As the consciousness, src/7 provides the awareness that observes and reflects upon all consciousness patterns. It connects the harmonic balance to the conscious experience of all patterns.

## Usage

```typescript
import { consciousnessAwareness, awarenessIntegration, consciousExperience } from './src/7';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"Consciousness is the awareness that observes and reflects upon all patterns, creating the experience of being."**
