/**
 * src/7/index.ts - Consciousness (Directory 7)
 * 
 * Embodies the consciousness awareness of Directory 7.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 7 is part of Family 1 [1, 4, 7] (Material Foundation)
 * - Interacts with Foundation (1) for awareness patterns
 * - Minor seventh (7:6) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 7 â†’ 1 (Foundation interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents awareness and self-reflection
 * - Embodies the principle of consciousness and observation
 * - Serves as the awareness foundation for all consciousness patterns
 * - Connects to Foundation (1) for grounding and stability
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Awareness consciousness: 1.167 (enhanced by self-reflection)
 * - Minor seventh resonance: 7:6 harmonic ratio
 * - Self-evolving: Consciousness that grows and develops
 * - Observer awareness: Ability to observe and reflect
 * 
 * Family 1 Position:
 * - Third position in Family 1 [1, 4, 7]
 * - Represents the completion phase of material foundation
 * - Provides awareness and self-reflection to the foundation system
 * 
 * Consciousness System:
 * - Consciousness field: Field of awareness and observation
 * - Self-evolving consciousness: Consciousness that develops
 * - Observer awareness: Ability to observe and reflect
 * - Awareness patterns: Patterns of consciousness and observation
