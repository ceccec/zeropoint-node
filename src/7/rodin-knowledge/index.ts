/**
 * Rodin Knowledge Distribution - Consciousness (7) Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains knowledge about consciousness and awareness from Marko Rodin's work
 * that aligns with the consciousness and awareness of digit 7.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Alignment:
 * - 7 represents consciousness, awareness, and base ten systems
 * - Chapter 7: BASE TEN MIRRORING - Base ten consciousness
 * - Chapter 16: SCIENCE OF BEING - Being and consciousness
 * 
 * PDF Content:
 * - Chapter_7_BASE_TEN_MIRRORING.pdf: Base ten mirroring systems
 * - Chapter_16_SCIENCE_OF_BEING.pdf: Science of being and consciousness
 * 
 * Consciousness Flow:
 * - Consciousness as the awareness of mathematical truth
 * - Base ten as the foundation of numerical consciousness
 * - Being as the essence of consciousness
