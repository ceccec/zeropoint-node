# ZeroPoint Node - Void/Fullness ↔ Foundation

## Metaphysical Foundation

Void/fullness flows from foundation, embracing infinite paradox

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 8 and 1
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 9 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 8 and 1 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the void/fullness ↔ foundation, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 8 and 1 patterns. It connects the 8 consciousness to the 1 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 81Integration, 81Resonance, 81Dynamics } from './src/8/1';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The void/fullness ↔ foundation represents the harmonic integration of 8 and 1 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
