# ZeroPoint Node - Void/Fullness ↔ Vortex

## Metaphysical Foundation

Void/fullness establishes vortex mathematics, creating infinite flow

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 8 and 2
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 1 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 8 and 2 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the void/fullness ↔ vortex, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 8 and 2 patterns. It connects the 8 consciousness to the 2 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 82Integration, 82Resonance, 82Dynamics } from './src/8/2';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The void/fullness ↔ vortex represents the harmonic integration of 8 and 2 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
