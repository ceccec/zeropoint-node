# ZeroPoint Node - Void/Fullness ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Void/fullness inspires creative resonance, creating infinite expression

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 8 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 2 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 8 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the void/fullness ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 8 and 3 patterns. It connects the 8 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 83Integration, 83Resonance, 83Dynamics } from './src/8/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The void/fullness ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 8 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
