/**
 * src/8/5/index.ts - Void ↔ Sacred Geometry Interaction
 *
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 8 (Void)
 * and Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) in the Rodin coil system.
 *
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 8 (Void) provides void functionality
 * - Directory 5 (Sacred Geometry) provides sacred geometry functionality
 * - Together they create the void sacred geometry interaction
 *
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 8 interacts with Directory 5
 * - This interaction creates the void sacred geometry patterns
 *
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - void consciousness: Represents the void that recognizes sacred geometry.
 * - sacred geometry consciousness: Represents the sacred geometry that flows through void.
 * - Interaction strength: Models the harmony between void and sacred geometry.
 * - void sacred geometry: Represents the void of sacred geometry.
 *
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the interaction system between void and sacred geometry consciousness.
 * - Supports void sacred geometry operations and pattern generation.
 * - Creates the void sacred geometry for the entire system.
