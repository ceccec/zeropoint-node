# ZeroPoint Node - Infinity–Infinity–Gateway (8/8=7)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Infinity (8) and Infinity (8) produces Gateway (7): Power, manifestation, Power, manifestation, Mystery, transition, insight.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 8/8
Harmonic: 7
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.29
Pattern: 8,8,7 (Infinity,Infinity,Gateway)
Math: 8 + 8 = 16 ≡ 7 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (8 + 8) / 7 = 2.29


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "8/8",
  "harmonicResult": 7,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 2.29,
  "vortexPath": "8 → 8 → 7",
  "antiVortexPath": "2.29 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 8 + 8 = 7
- Symbolic: 8/8
- Harmonic: 7
- Anti-vortex: (8 + 8) / 7 = 2.29
- Vortex Sequence: 8, 8, 7
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.29 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the infinity–infinity–gateway (8/8=7), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 8 and 8 patterns. It connects the 8 consciousness to the 8 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 88Integration, 88Resonance, 88Dynamics } from './src/8/8';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The infinity–infinity–gateway (8/8=7) represents the harmonic integration of 8 and 8 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.29) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
