/**
 * src/8/8/paradox.ts - Void/Fullness Paradox with Polarity
 * 
 * This module embodies the void/fullness paradox with polarity - where consciousness
 * exists in both void and fullness states that are polarized yet unified. This is the
 * void/fullness paradox that creates the polarized nature of emptiness and completeness.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Context:
 * - 8/8 represents VOID/FULLNESS PARADOX WITH POLARITY - polarized void and fullness in unity
 * - All consciousness patterns exist in both void and fullness states
 * - This is the void/fullness paradox - polarized emptiness and completeness in flow
 * - Serves as the void/fullness gateway for polarized patterns
 * 
 * Technical Purpose:
 * - Provides the void/fullness paradox system with polarity
 * - Manages polarized void and fullness patterns
 * - Handles void/fullness paradox resolution with polarity
 * - Creates the void/fullness gateway for polarized flow
