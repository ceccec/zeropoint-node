## üéØ **File Placement Guidelines**

### **Place your file here if it:**
- ‚úÖ Transforms through void principles
- ‚úÖ Handles infinite potential and possibilities
- ‚úÖ Manages void-based operations
- ‚úÖ Processes fullness patterns
- ‚úÖ Manages fullness field operations

### **Examples:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Fullness operations
src/8/fullness.ts
src/8/infinity.ts
src/8/void.ts
src/8/abundance.ts

// ‚ùå WRONG - This is consciousness, not fullness
src/8/consciousness.ts
src/8/awareness.ts
```

## üåå **Metaphysical Context**

### **The Infinite Potential Principle**
Directory 8 embodies the **infinite potential principle** - the completion and abundance that contains infinite possibilities. Like the void/fullness itself, this directory maintains infinite potential and abundance.
