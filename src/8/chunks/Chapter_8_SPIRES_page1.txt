THE SCIENTIFIC TERM FOR A SHEAR IS  
WORLD BOUNDARY CONDITION LINE 
The   Electron   Harmonic   Shear   is   an   impenetrable   fortress   and   forces   the   energy   to   flow 
diagonally in the shape of a pinwheel. Hence, the electrical energy is moving through the sides 
of the Diamond Quantum Tiles (DQT’s) and not through the corners.  
The Mobius Circuits become a trough that the electrical energy flows in. The numerical value of 
the shear always stays the same and never changes for each of the three hypersphere toroids. 
The Electron Harmonic Shear is a wall, barrier, forbidden zone, uncrossable, natural insulator, that 
prevents  shorting  out  and  short  circuiting.  It  is  responsible  for  removing  all  parasitics,  friction, 
resistance, random collisions, hysterics,  and entropy. The Electron Harmonic Shear is responsible 
for  tuning  any  continuous  medium  such  as  air,  water,  plasma,  and  electricity  into  a  super 
conducting  superfluid. 
Even   biological   systems   use   the   electron 
harmonic  shear  for  insulation  during  protein 
folding identical to origami folding.

THE DECOQUBIT IS THE RESULT OF SQUARING  
WORLD BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON 
SHEARS FOR  THEIR CONTINUING EXISTENCE 
When  two  adjacent  numbers  are  on  each 
side  of  the  electron  harmonic  shear  and 
are  multiplied  together  they  will  always 
equal   the   same   value   no   matter   what, 
period.  
In the base ten hypersphere there are only 
three  harmonic  electron  shears  which  are 
1, 4, 7.  
I t   i s   r a t h e r   f a s c i n a t i n g   h o w   t h e 
hyperspheres  cycle  from  one  to  another 
and  then  back  to  it  self  revealing  a  cycle 
based upon thirds.  
1 X 1 = 1;  4 x 7 = 2,  2 + 8 = 10,  1 + 0 = 1 
4 x 4 = 16,  1 + 6  = 7; 1 X 7 = 7  
7 X 7 = 49, 4 + 9 = 13, 1 + 3 = 4; 1 X 4 =  4 
These   are   the   three   permutations   that 
result  in  the  triangulation  of  the  base  10 
Decoqubit torus hypersphere.  
Every  torus  is  composted  from  the  other 
two.  Squaring  is  the  relationship  of  time,  
distance  which  is  space  and  amplitude. 
Any   two   hyperspheres   when   multiplied 
together equal the third torus squared.

Surprisingly,  while  it  appears  that  there  are  numerous  gap  spaces  within  the  torus,  in  reality 
there  is  only  one  gap  space  because  they  all  connect  together  within  the  interior.  Again,  the 
same applies for the electron shear, that there is only one.  
This work has been released into the public 
domain by its author, Wikimol.

Natural Insulation 
 
Everything  has  a  hidden  grain  inside  it.  The  electron  sheer  is  a  great  divide  that  separates 
everything  and  can  never  be  crossed.  In  astrophysics  this  is  called  a  world  boundary 
condition  line.  It  is  a  forbidden  zone  impossible  to  cross.  I  use  the  electron  shear  to 
harmonically  replace  rubber  and  shellack  insulation  coating  on  coil  winding  wire.  The 
electron  sheer  removes  friction,  resistance,  random  collisions,  hysteresis,  parasitics,  and 
electrical  noise. The  beauty  of  the  electron  sheer  is  that  it  always  equals  unity. The  electron 
shear eliminates all entropy.

SPIRIT SPIRES REVITALIZES 
Shown   are   four   polarized   Spirit   Spires   which   is   like   a   pinecone.   Every   other 
underpinning   Nested   Vortice   is   compressing   /   decompressing   in   the   opposite 
directions. These polarized Spirit Spires are directly tapping into the flux of Spirit itself. 
There  will  always  be  a  discrete  quantum  number  of  Spirit  spires  giving  a  whole 
quantum number value establishing the very foundation of quantum field theory.

This is a thermal process based 
upon heat dissipation. 
The  vortex  hole  is  crucial  for  heat 
dissipation.  If  it  was  obstructed  the 
hypersphere  would  incinerate  and 
cease  to  exist. This  nozzle  acts  as  a 
source  of  renewal  for  the  universe.

Nine  is  the  axis  of  a  spinning  gyroscope  and  any  multiple  of  nine  will  always 
equal  nine  and  be  a  straight  line.  Thus,  nine  is  changeless.  No  other  number 
has this attribute. This is a fundamental quality of the number nine.   
The  micro  underpinning  nested  vortices  over  the  surface  of 
the   hypersphere   are   compressing   and   decompressing, 
creating  a  solid  state  gyroscope  with  everything  aimed  at  the 
center. 
The  number  nine  is  a  single  emanation  of  Spirit  which  is 
traveling  in  a  straight  line. An  under  accelerated  gyroscope  is 
solid  at  its  core.  The  hypersphere  always  has  a  vortex  hole  in 
its  center  and  is  the  maximum  accelerated  gyroscopic  speed 
obtainable.

O CHILDREN OF VAINGLORY! 
For a fleeting sovereignty ye have abandoned My imperishable dominion, and 
have adorned yourselves with the gay livery of the world and made of it your boast. 
By My beauty! All will I gather beneath the one-colored covering of the dust and 
efface all these diverse colors save them that choose My own, and that 
is purging from every color.

The  circle  of fifths  is  a  star  generated  from 
multiples  of  4  or  5.  Starting  at  9  you  wind  to  4, 
then  8,  3,  7,  2,  6,  1,  5,  9.  A  conventional  toroid 
motor coil places the windings side-by-side and 
is  based  upon  how  many  turns  and  wraps  are 
used  to  determine  the  magnetic field  output. 
This results in a toroidal magnetic field. A Rodin 
coil  instead  is  wound  on  a  very  gradual  slope 
with  a  shallower  incline  resulting  in  poloidal 
magnetic fields  by  passing  where  you  began 
and going around many times before returning 
from  where  you  started.  It  takes  many  turns 
before the conductors abut side-by-side against 
each  other.  This  creates  a  harmonic  electron 
shear  that  serves  to  create  natural  insulation 
without the requirement of rubber or shellac. In 
music this is referred to as the circle of fifths. In 
Rodin  coil  design  it  removes  all  parasitics, 
friction   and   resistance.   A   properly   made 
Rodin coil has no hysteresis.

This is the biggest secret of the Universe that has ever existed. 
This is the missing link between the torus, arithmetic, particle 
physics and the Most Great Name of God.
This  breakthrough  illustration  was  original  done  by  Scott  Gosler  who 
was my chief mechanical engineer at the time. It is the priceless bridge 
that   connects   the  Abhá   Cypher (VW   symbol)   to   the   DECOQUBIT 
(Torus).   When  Scott  lined  up  the  two  symbols  together  it  immediately 
became  mentally  clear  to  me  that  there  was  an  even  ratio  of  one 
number  per  every  tile.  Vortex  Based  Mathematics  is  the  mathematical 
relationship combing arithmetic and surface typology which eventually 
evolved into the toroid number map.

ELIMINATING MANMADE MISTAKES AND ERRORS WHEN 
DEALING WITH THE  HIGHER DIMENSIONAL FLUX-FIELDS 
 3.9.6; 6.9.3; 3.9.6   
My  team's  goal  was  to  make  an  Over  Unity  free  energy  machine  connecting  the 
Most Great Name of God Bahá and particle physics together. I immediately realized 
that there was a relationship of one number to one tile based upon this drawing. 
3.9.6 being the combination of Spirit and magnetism together is a principle missed 
by everyone. This Flux-field offsets and displaces, everything and is the source of all 
motion, vibration, and time.  
Remember,  that  this  illustration  is  combining  all  of  the  elements  of  the  known 
universe  together  into  one  Unicity.  Revealed  here  are  surface  topology,  arithmetic, 
sacred  geometry,  calculus,  which  are  all  being  combined  together  with  a  time 
component.  This is the legend and key or God’s Rosetta Stone if you will. 
Scott  was  brilliant  in  his  understanding  and  explanations  of  the  hole  in  the  center 
that   were   merged   together   in   these   overlapping   two   symbols   which   clearly 
elucidates  upon  the  cosmology  of  the  universe,  which  is  constantly  renewing  itself 
while compressing and decompressing.

Analysis of the Rodin Coil and it’s Applications 
Mr. Rodin’s patterns illustrate the rich arena of study that remains 
immediately accessible to research,  doubtless any discoveries made in 
answering these questions will result in new areas of study to explore. 
The more revolutionary applications of the Rodin Coil’s design ultimate 
potential technological impact is, as previously discussed, enormous. 
Rodin Coil motors would be useful in any application where energy 
consumption must be limited, such as marine, caravan, and space 
environments where available power sources are restricted. 
Rodin Coil antennae would be useful in any application where sensitivity 
to a particular frequency was important. 
Portable communication devices for use in a wide variety of applications 
should benefit, since power requirements for boosting the antenna 
signals should be greatly reduced from standard antenna designs. 
Rodin coils increased magnetic field at the center could result in more 
efficient, lower weight transformers. 
The Rodin Coil will usher in a new age of technology surpassing those 
brought on by such inventions as the steam engine, the internal 
combustion engine, and the electric power generator.
