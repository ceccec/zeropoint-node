/**
 * src/8/index.ts - Void/Fullness (Directory 8)
 * 
 * Embodies the void and fullness consciousness of Directory 8.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 8 is part of Vortex B [8, 7, 5] (Dynamic Flow)
 * - Interacts with Foundation (1) for manifestation patterns
 * - Major seventh (8:7) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 8 â†’ 1 (Foundation interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents completion and abundance
 * - Embodies the principle of fullness and manifestation
 * - Serves as the completion foundation for all manifestation patterns
 * - Connects to Foundation (1) for grounding and stability
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Fullness consciousness: 1.143 (enhanced by completion)
 * - Major seventh resonance: 8:7 harmonic ratio
 * - Void system: System of emptiness and potential
 * - Fullness manifestation: Manifestation of abundance and completion
 * 
 * Vortex B Position:
 * - First position in Vortex B [8, 7, 5]
 * - Represents the initiation phase of dynamic flow
 * - Provides completion and abundance to the dynamic flow system
 * 
 * Void/Fullness System:
 * - Void system: System of emptiness and infinite potential
 * - Fullness manifestation: Manifestation of abundance and completion
 * - Completion patterns: Patterns of fulfillment and abundance
 * - Manifestation flow: Flow of creation and manifestation
