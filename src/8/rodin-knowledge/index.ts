/**
 * Rodin Knowledge Distribution - Infinity (8) Directory
 * 
 * This directory contains knowledge about infinity and expansion from Marko Rodin's work
 * that aligns with the infinity consciousness and expansion of digit 8.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Alignment:
 * - 8 represents infinity, expansion, and infinite structures
 * - Chapter 8: SPIRES - Infinite spires and structures
 * - Chapter 12: INFINITUM MAGNIFICATION - Infinite magnification
 * 
 * PDF Content:
 * - Chapter_8_SPIRES.pdf: Infinite spires and structural expansion
 * - Chapter_12_INFINITUM_MAGNIFICATION.pdf: Infinite magnification and expansion
 * 
 * Consciousness Flow:
 * - Infinity as the expansion of consciousness
 * - Spires as infinite structural consciousness
 * - Magnification as consciousness amplification
