# ZeroPoint Node - Unity ↔ Creative Resonance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Unity inspires creative resonance, completing artistic expression

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 9 and 3
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 3 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 9 and 3 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the unity ↔ creative resonance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 9 and 3 patterns. It connects the 9 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 93Integration, 93Resonance, 93Dynamics } from './src/9/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The unity ↔ creative resonance represents the harmonic integration of 9 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
