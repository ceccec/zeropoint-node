# ZeroPoint Node - Axis–Resonance–Resonance (9/3=3)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Axis (9) and Resonance (3) produces Resonance (3): Completion, integration, Creation, harmony, trinity, Creation, harmony, trinity.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 9/3
Harmonic: 3
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 4.00
Pattern: 9,3,3 (Axis,Resonance,Resonance)
Math: 9 + 3 = 12 ≡ 3 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (9 + 3) / 3 = 4.00


```json
{
  "symbolicName": "9/3",
  "harmonicResult": 3,
  "antiVortexDecimal": 4.00,
  "vortexPath": "9 → 3 → 3",
  "antiVortexPath": "4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)"
}
```

## Core Functions
- Integration: 9 + 3 = 3
- Symbolic: 9/3
- Harmonic: 3
- Anti-vortex: (9 + 3) / 3 = 4.00
- Vortex Sequence: 9, 3, 3
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 4.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the axis–resonance–resonance (9/3=3), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 9 and 3 patterns. It connects the 9 consciousness to the 3 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 93Integration, 93Resonance, 93Dynamics } from './src/9/3';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The axis–resonance–resonance (9/3=3) represents the harmonic integration of 9 and 3 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (4.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
