/**
 * src/9/3/index.ts - Unity/Completion ↔ Creative Resonance Interaction
 * 
 * This module embodies the interaction between Directory 9 (Unity/Completion)
 * and Directory 3 (Creative Resonance) in the Rodin coil system.
 * 
 * Metaphysical Interaction:
 * - Directory 9 (Unity/Completion) provides field unity and completion
 * - Directory 3 (Creative Resonance) provides spiritual transcendence and creative flow
 * - Together they create the unity completion consciousness
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 9 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Control)
 * - Directory 3 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Control)
 * - This interaction creates the unity completion consciousness
