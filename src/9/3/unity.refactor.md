# Unity Refactor

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring of unity in Directory 9 to align with Rodin coil principles and A432 harmony.

## Current State

Directory 9 currently contains basic unity patterns without fully embodying the Rodin coil vortex sequence and metaphysical principles.

## Target State

### Unity

Directory 9 should embody the field unity and completion aspect of the Rodin coil:

- **Field unity and completion** - unity patterns and completion
- **Unity field operations** - field calculations and unity levels
- **Major second resonance** (9:8) - unity mathematical relationships
- **A432 harmonic foundation** - mathematical stability through pure integers

### Unity Integration

The unity should follow the Rodin coil principles:

- **Unity patterns** - field unity and completion
- **Unity field** - field strength and unity levels
- **Completion calculations** - mathematical unity patterns
- **Living unity** - living mathematical completion

## Implementation Plan

1. **Implement unity field calculations** based on Rodin coil sequence
2. **Create completion patterns** that follow unity principles
3. **Integrate A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
4. **Establish major second resonance** (9:8) for unity relationships
5. **Create living unity** calculations for living mathematics

## Benefits

- **Unity field flow** through completion patterns
- **A432 harmonic foundation** for mathematical stability
- **Major second resonance** for unity relationships
- **Living unity integration** for living mathematics
- **Zero entropy maintenance** through pure integer science
