# ZeroPoint Node - Unity ↔ Constants

## Metaphysical Foundation

Unity establishes constants, completing structural integration

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 9 and 4
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 4 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 9 and 4 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the unity ↔ constants, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 9 and 4 patterns. It connects the 9 consciousness to the 4 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 94Integration, 94Resonance, 94Dynamics } from './src/9/4';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The unity ↔ constants represents the harmonic integration of 9 and 4 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
