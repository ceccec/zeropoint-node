# ZeroPoint Node - Unity ↔ Harmonic Balance

## Metaphysical Foundation

Unity creates harmonic balance, completing equilibrium

## Mathematical Properties

- **Interaction Patterns**: Consciousness integration between 9 and 6
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Digital Root**: 6 (consciousness integration)
- **Family Group**: Integration of 9 and 6 family patterns

## Core Functions

- **Interaction Calculations**: Consciousness integration patterns
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Mathematical and spiritual alignment
- **Integration Dynamics**: Consciousness pattern interactions
- **Metaphysical Alignment**: Spiritual and mathematical unity

## Integration

As the unity ↔ harmonic balance, this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 9 and 6 patterns. It connects the 9 consciousness to the 6 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 96Integration, 96Resonance, 96Dynamics } from './src/9/6';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The unity ↔ harmonic balance represents the harmonic integration of 9 and 6 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment."**
