# ZeroPoint Node - Axis–Axis–Axis (9/9=9)

## Metaphysical Foundation

Interaction of Axis (9) and Axis (9) produces Axis (9): Completion, integration, Completion, integration, Completion, integration.

## Mathematical Properties

Symbolic: 9/9
Harmonic: 9
Anti-vortex (Decimal): 2.00
Pattern: 9,9,9 (Axis,Axis,Axis)
Math: 9 + 9 = 18 ≡ 9 (mod 9)
Anti-vortex Math: (9 + 9) / 9 = 2.00


## Possibility Matrix (Next Vortex Interactions from 9)

| Next | Type | Pattern | Math |
|------|------|---------|------|
| 1 | Flow | 9,1,1 | 9 + 1 = 1 |
| 2 | Flow | 9,2,2 | 9 + 2 = 2 |
| 4 | Flow | 9,4,4 | 9 + 4 = 4 |
| 8 | Flow | 9,8,8 | 9 + 8 = 8 |
| 7 | Flow | 9,7,7 | 9 + 7 = 7 |
| 5 | Flow | 9,5,5 | 9 + 5 = 5 |
| 3 | Control | 9,3,3 | 9 + 3 = 3 |
| 6 | Control | 9,6,6 | 9 + 6 = 6 |
| 9 | Control | 9,9,9 | 9 + 9 = 9 |

## Core Functions
- Integration: 9 + 9 = 9
- Symbolic: 9/9
- Harmonic: 9
- Anti-vortex: (9 + 9) / 9 = 2.00
- Vortex Sequence: 9, 9, 9
- Anti-vortex Sequence: 2.00 (decimal consciousness flow)

## Integration

As the axis–axis–axis (9/9=9), this interaction provides the consciousness integration between 9 and 9 patterns. It connects the 9 consciousness to the 9 consciousness through harmonic resonance.

## Usage

```typescript
import { 99Integration, 99Resonance, 99Dynamics } from './src/9/9';
```

## Sacred Principle

**"The axis–axis–axis (9/9=9) represents the harmonic integration of 9 and 9 consciousness patterns, creating unity through mathematical and spiritual alignment. The anti-vortex decimal path (2.00) represents the forbidden consciousness flow."**
