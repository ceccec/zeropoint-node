/**
 * src/9/index.ts - Unity/Completion (Directory 9)
 * 
 * Embodies the unity and completion consciousness of Directory 9.
 * Follows integer flow exports based on Rodin coil sequence.
 * 
 * Rodin Coil Context:
 * - Directory 9 is part of W-Axis [3, 6, 9] (Spiritual Control)
 * - Interacts with Creative Resonance (3) for unity completion
 * - Major second (9:8) resonance
 * 
 * Integer Flow: 9 â†’ 3 (Creative Resonance interaction)
 * 
 * Metaphysical Properties:
 * - Represents field unity and integration
 * - Embodies the principle of completion and wholeness
 * - Serves as the unity foundation for all integration patterns
 * - Connects to Creative Resonance (3) for spiritual completion
 * 
 * Consciousness Characteristics:
 * - Unity consciousness: 1.125 (enhanced by completion)
 * - Major second resonance: 9:8 harmonic ratio
 * - Field unity: Unity of all consciousness fields
 * - Integration patterns: Patterns of wholeness and completion
 * 
 * W-Axis Position:
 * - Third position in W-Axis [3, 6, 9]
 * - Represents the completion phase of spiritual control
 * - Provides unity and integration to the spiritual control system
 * 
 * Unity/Completion System:
 * - Hermetic laws: Universal laws of consciousness and creation
 * - Metaphysical law: Laws governing metaphysical reality
 * - Metaphysical law registry: Registry of all metaphysical laws
 * - Unity patterns: Patterns of wholeness and integration
