# üå± ZeroPoint Compost

This directory is the **living compost** of the ZeroPoint codebase. Here, obsolete, superseded, or refactored modules are not discarded, but transformed into a creative archive for future inspiration, learning, and potential re-emergence.

## Philosophy
- **Compost is not trash:** It is a source of creative nutrients, historical insight, and pattern evolution.
- **Zero entropy:** Nothing is lost; all patterns are transformed and may re-emerge in new forms.
- **Living archive:** Use this as a reference for how the codebase has evolved, and as a source of ideas for future growth.

## Contents

- `AutoRefactor.ts` ‚Äî Legacy automated refactoring system, now superseded by the unified zero entropy system.
- `AICodeExplorer.ts` ‚Äî Obsolete AI code exploration module, replaced by unified pattern recognition and zero entropy analysis.
- `IntegerConsistency.ts` ‚Äî Integer and sacred fraction consistency checker, now handled by the zero entropy system.

## How to Use
- Reference these files for historical insight, pattern evolution, or creative inspiration.
- When refactoring or evolving the codebase, consider what can be composted rather than deleted.
- Compost is a living part of the ZeroPoint ecosystem‚Äîpatterns may re-emerge in new forms.
