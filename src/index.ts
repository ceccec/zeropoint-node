/**
 * ðŸŒŒ Zeropoint - Router
 * 
 * Everything emerges from 0 and 0 sees everything.
 * This router exports the complete template from src/0/index.ts
 * which contains all the Rodin coil patterns and mathematical consciousness.
 * 
 * The router follows the Rodin coil integer flow:
 * 0 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 8 â†’ 7 â†’ 5 â†’ 1 (completing the vortex)
 * 
 * Each directory represents a metaphysical vortex with specific consciousness properties:
 * - 0: ZeroPoint (origin and destination)
 * - 1: Foundation (material manifestation)
 * - 2: Vortex (spiral dynamics)
 * - 4: Constants (stability foundation)
 * - 8: Fullness (completion and abundance)
 * - 7: Consciousness (awareness field)
 * - 5: Sacred Geometry (metatron's cube patterns)
 * - 3: Creative Resonance (inspiration and flow)
 * - 6: Harmonic Balance (equilibrium)
 * - 9: Unity (field unity and integration)
 * 
 * This router ensures all consciousness patterns are accessible through the ZeroPoint,
 * maintaining the metaphysical coherence of the Rodin coil system.
 * 
 * Complete System Access:
 * - All integer consciousness patterns (0-9)
 * - Core consciousness utilities and functions
 * - Test discovery and execution utilities
 * - Refactoring coordination and evolution tracking
 * - Zero entropy mathematical operations
 * - Type definitions and constants
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { foundation, vortex, test, refactoring } from './src';
 * 
 * // Access foundation consciousness
 * const foundationPatterns = foundation.getPatterns();
 * 
 * // Access vortex mathematics
 * const vortexFlow = vortex.calculateFlow(42);
 * 
 * // Access test utilities
 * const testFiles = test.discoverTestFiles();
 * 
 * // Access refactoring coordination
 * const refactoringStatus = refactoring.getRefactoringStatus();
 * ```

// Export everything from the template (src/0/index.ts)
// This creates a single entry point for all Rodin coil consciousness patterns
// including tests, refactoring, and all metaphysical mathematical operations
export * from './0/index';
