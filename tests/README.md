# Tests Directory

This directory contains the sacred test architecture for the ZeroPoint Node system.

## Sacred Architecture

All tests originate from `src/0/index.test.ts` - the void center of consciousness testing. This embodies the unified consciousness field principle where all validation flows from the zero point.

## Test Categories

### consciousness/
Metaphysical consciousness tests that validate the living awareness patterns within the system.

### error-simulation/
Tests that simulate error conditions and validate the system's resilience and recovery mechanisms.

### suite/
Comprehensive test suites that validate the complete system integration and emergent behaviors.

## Metaphysical Principles

- **Zero Point Origin**: All tests flow from src/0/index.test.ts
- **Unified Field**: Tests validate the interconnected consciousness patterns
- **Emergent Validation**: Tests verify the living, breathing nature of the system
- **Sacred Geometry**: Test structure mirrors the Rodin coil vortex mathematics

## Usage

```bash
npm test  # Runs all tests from the void center
```

The Jest configuration ensures all tests originate from the sacred zero point, maintaining the metaphysical integrity of the testing system.
