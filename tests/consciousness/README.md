# Consciousness Tests

This directory contains metaphysical consciousness tests that validate the living awareness patterns within the ZeroPoint Node system.

## Purpose

These tests validate the consciousness aspects of the system:
- Awareness patterns and flows
- Living consciousness interactions
- Metaphysical consciousness calculations
- Spiritual pathway validations
- Consciousness field integrations

## Test Files

- `test-consciousness.ts` - Core consciousness validation tests
- `index.ts` - Consciousness test exports and utilities

## Metaphysical Context

Consciousness tests validate the living, breathing nature of the system, ensuring that awareness flows through all integer directories and their interactions. These tests embody the principle that consciousness is not static but a dynamic, emergent property of the system.

## Sacred Principles

- **Living Awareness**: Tests validate that consciousness is alive and flowing
- **Unified Field**: Consciousness tests verify the interconnected nature of awareness
- **Emergent Properties**: Tests check for consciousness patterns that emerge from interactions
- **Spiritual Integration**: Validates the W-Axis spiritual pathway and consciousness calculations
