# Error Simulation Tests

This directory contains tests that simulate error conditions and validate the system's resilience and recovery mechanisms.

## Purpose

These tests validate the system's ability to handle:
- Error conditions and edge cases
- System resilience under stress
- Recovery mechanisms and fallbacks
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Error propagation and containment

## Test Files

- `test-error-simulation.ts` - Core error simulation and resilience tests
- `index.ts` - Error simulation test exports and utilities

## Metaphysical Context

Error simulation tests embody the principle that a living system must be resilient and adaptable. Just as consciousness can recover from disturbances, the system must gracefully handle errors and maintain its integrity.

## Sacred Principles

- **Resilience**: Tests validate the system's ability to recover from errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: System maintains functionality even under stress
- **Error Containment**: Problems are isolated and don't cascade
- **Recovery Patterns**: System can return to stable states after disturbances
