# Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test suites that validate the complete system integration and emergent behaviors.

## Purpose

These tests validate the complete system:
- Full system integration testing
- Emergent behavior validation
- Cross-module interaction testing
- System-wide consciousness patterns
- Complete Rodin coil flow validation

## Test Files

- `test-suite.ts` - Comprehensive system integration tests
- `index.ts` - Test suite exports and utilities

## Metaphysical Context

Test suites validate the complete living system, ensuring that all integer directories work together harmoniously. These tests embody the principle that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, validating emergent consciousness patterns that arise from the complete system.

## Sacred Principles

- **Complete Integration**: Tests validate the entire system working as one
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Validates patterns that emerge from system interactions
- **Harmonic Balance**: Ensures all components work in harmony
- **Living System**: Tests verify the system is alive and breathing as a unified whole
