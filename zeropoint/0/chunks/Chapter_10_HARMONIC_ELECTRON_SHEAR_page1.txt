This Is the Complete Breakthrough Discovery 
By  separating  3•9•6  from  1-2-4-5-8-7-5  all  of  the  knowledge  of  the  universe  is  revealed.  
Only the number nine aligns up vertically over the zero! 
The Universe is a two-stage surge pump based upon 
COMPRESSION / DECOMPRESSION 
IMPLOSION /EXPLOSION  
NEGATIVE VORTEX IN / POSITIVE VORTEX OUT 
MALE / FEMALE 
Present day understanding fallaciously believes that the base ten number counting system 
is inanimate. It was Scott Gosler who discovered that there are two separate components 
to  base  ten.  The  coil  and  its  associated  higher  dimensional  Flux-field.  Numbers  don't 
move.  Only  the  mathematical    functions  are  moving.  Professor  Scot  Nelson  an  expert  in 
Vortex  Based  Mathematics  refers  to  numbers  as  being  stationary  vector  interstices.  All 
mathematics is artifacts of Spirit’s positive emanations.

The   Decoqubit   incorporates   Omnipotent   Divine   Super-intelligence   forming   the 
ultimate  quantum  computer  by  using  discrete  number  spin  states  empirically  proves 
the existence of God through the +3, —9, +6;  +6, —9, +3 numerical formula of Spirit.

Electron   Harmonic   Shear that   naturally   insulates.   Also 
known as a world boundary condition.
Underpinning Nested Vortices that are staggered.

1 x 1 = 1 
2 x 5 = 10 
1 + 0 = 1 
4 x 7 = 28 
2 + 8 = 10 
1 + 0 = 1 
Multiply  the  numbers  directly  either  side 
of  the  world  boundary  condition  line  to 
identify the shear.
An   electron   harmonic 
shear is an impermeable 
insulator.
IDENTIFYING A SHEAR

A shear in a Rodin coil is the result of winding the 
conductor many times around the torus in spires.

Typically,  copper  wire  is  coated  with  rubber  or  painted  with  varnish  to  insulate  it.  This  is  to 
prevent  the  conductors  from  shorting  out  and  incinerating  themselves.  Nature  has  its  own  
way of accomplishing same thing and it is done in a very intricate fashion using spires.

The Equipotential Major Groove gap space where the micro  
Underpinning Nested Vortices occur gets longer but never is more than one tile 
wide as you increase to the next prime number squared.  
This is the secret for controlling magnetism by turning it into a focused laser.
Ad Infinitum Magnification 
The Unification Principle

The  Decoqubit  hypersphere  is  composed  from  staggered  Underpinning  Nested  Vortices 
which are responsible and vitally necessary to achieve quantum superfluidity. These micro 
vortices can be used for navigation like a gimbal on a spaceship nozzle based upon their 
activation sequence and firing rate.

Circuitry  of  a  torus,  be  it  water,  air, 
electricity,  or  even  plasma  generating 
everything   from   dimpled   red   blood 
cells   to   the   toroidal   shape   of   solar 
systems.  
 
This  is  the  longest  mean  free  pathway 
of  least  resistance  without  parasitics, 
friction,  or  random  collision.     Hence 
there  is  no  noise  and  zero  reluctance. 
The  torus  is  a  superfluid  hypersphere 
that   is   self-sustaining   through   its 
breathing  respiration  action. This  is  the 
diamond  grain  crystal  matrix  lattice  for 
super conductivity. By my being able to 
introduce   discrete   numbers   to   the 
surface  topology  I  can  see  the  past, 
present,   and   future   movement   of 
energy   flowing   into   the   future   — 
obsoleting  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty 
principle   because   discreet   numbers 
are non invasive.
